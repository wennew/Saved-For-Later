					<p>Up to now, methodological details within <i>Nature Geoscience</i> papers had to be kept brief. More detail could be provided in Supplementary Information files online, but with the drawback that they need to be opened separately, and that references in this material are not counted as citations by indexing services such as Scopus or Thomson Web of Science. We are now addressing these shortcomings by offering more space for Methods and their references within the online paper, as an integral part of both the HTML and PDF versions (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2438">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2438</a> for an example).</p><p>Scientific papers, and the ways they are being read, have changed dramatically. Physical copies of the journal have become much less important as almost all scientists access, read and file their scientific intake online. At the same time, more rigour and detail in methods descriptions is required, as well as acknowledgement and traceability of source material. So it makes sense to offer fully integrated online-only space for better documentation of methods within the article.</p><p>Unlike Supplementary Information, online-only methods will be copy-edited. Importantly, online-only methods can contain all the relevant references fully accounted for by the indexing services. There is a limit of 3,000 words, not counting the reference list: we cannot offer copy-editing on unlimited amounts of text. But keep in mind that it is in the interest of both readers and referees to keep the Methods concise, without compromising on completeness. We feel that for most of the brief articles we publish, this space should be sufficient.</p><p>Supplementary Tables and Figures are not accommodated within the article in an online-only fashion; these will continue to be published in separate files as Supplementary Information.</p><p>We do not want to lose flexibility. Therefore for rare exceptions — for example, where supplementary methods and supplementary figures cannot easily be separated — we continue to offer the option of methods descriptions and other text material in Supplementary Information. But we appeal to our authors to think twice before they opt to separate the information on how they obtained their conclusions from the paper itself. In the vast majority of cases, we feel that readers — and authors of any cited papers — are better served by an extended online-only Methods section.</p>
