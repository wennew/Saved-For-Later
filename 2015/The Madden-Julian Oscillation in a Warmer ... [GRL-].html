		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Global warming's impact on the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is assessed using one of the few models capable in reproducing its key features. In a warmer climate predicted for the end of the century, the MJO increases in amplitude (by ~30%) and frequency, showing a more circumglobal propagation tendency. The MJO spatial extent becomes enhanced, deeper and more zonally extended but meridionally confined. A stronger vertical tilting structure in diabatic heating, moisture and convergence fields is seen. Our findings indicate that these changes result from an intensification of the frictional-wave CISK mechanism via the coupling of dynamical and thermodynamic response to the warming. The warming and moistening of the mean state contribute to the enhanced deep convective heating, driving a stronger forced Kelvin wave-like perturbation. This reinforces the frictional low-level convergence, leading to larger shallow convective heating, and therefore to a faster development and enhancement of the deep convection in the MJO.</p></div>
