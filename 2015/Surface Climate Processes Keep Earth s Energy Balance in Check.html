<p>Bumping up atmospheric carbon dioxide levels causes temperatures to rise across Earth’s surface. This direct climate correlation is well established, but measuring carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels is not enough to build accurate climate models. Making precise predictions of temperature and weather patterns around the globe requires models that incorporate what scientists call feedbacks, an array of secondary changes that can amplify or diminish climate change.</p>
<p>As Earth warms, it radiates heat back into space, creating a negative feedback. But extra moisture in the air acts to trap outgoing radiation, further increasing the temperature. When the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs more energy than it reflects or releases, the planet warms and vice versa. Taken together, these processes direct <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_02.pdf" target="_blank">radiative forcing</a>, or the overall balance of energy, to keep energy gains and losses in equilibrium.</p>
<p>Traditionally, scientists have studied the processes behind these gains and losses in energy where the action happens—at the top of Earth’s atmosphere. There, the feedback processes at work to keep the amount of energy lost and gained in equilibrium determine global temperatures.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that these same processes operate at the planet’s surface and can drive fluctuations in surface temperatures, the water cycle, and weather patterns that have direct impacts on humans and the environment. But uncertainties in the strength and structure of surface energy responses remained. Recently, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JD022896/full" target="_blank"><em>Colman</em></a> aimed to create a more comprehensive picture of the radiative feedbacks operating at Earth’s surface when CO<sub>2</sub> levels steeply climb.</p>
