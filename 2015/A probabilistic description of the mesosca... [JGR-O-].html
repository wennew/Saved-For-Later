Results are compared with those obtained from the AVISO 19 year, 1/3° gridded SLA space-time objective analysis and associated geostrophic velocity anomalies. The study reveals that eddy variability appears to be Gaussian over most parts of the ocean, outside the influence of energetic current systems, and that specific flow regimes in the ocean can be identified through higher statistical moments of the flow field and SLA observations.
