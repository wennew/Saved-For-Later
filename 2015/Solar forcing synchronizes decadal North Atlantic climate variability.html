					<h2>North Atlantic climate response to the 11-year solar cycle</h2><p>In winter (December to February), SLP composite differences between solar maximum and solar minimum phases at lag 0 years (see the Methods section and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>) for the SOL experiment (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f1">Fig. 1a</a>) show a statistically significant decrease of 2<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa over the Arctic region, and a statistically significant increase of 1<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa in mid-latitudes with maxima in the Euro-Atlantic region and Pacific basin, corresponding to the positive phase of the AO. At lag <span class="mb">+</span>1 year (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f1">Fig. 1b</a>), the mid-latitude positive SLP anomaly strengthens in the Euro-Atlantic region up to 1.5<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa and weakens in the Pacific basin resulting in a positive NAO-like pattern. The positive NAO signature still persists at lags <span class="mb">+</span>2 and <span class="mb">+</span>3 years in the Atlantic basin, but the hemispheric equivalent annular mode signal disappears (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f1">Fig. 1c,d</a>). At a lag of <span class="mb">+</span>3 years, the statistically significant high-pressure anomaly in mid-latitudes is further amplified, consistent with the ocean feedback mechanism that predicts a maximum response at a lag of <span class="mb">+</span>3 years<sup><a href="#ref18" title="Scaife, A. A. et al. A mechanism for lagged North Atlantic climate response to solar variability. Geophys. Res. Lett. 40, 434-439 (2013)." id="ref-link-31">18</a></sup>. The corresponding sea surface temperature anomalies (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f1">Fig. 1e–h</a>) evolve coherently with the lagged SLP NAO-like response to solar variability. Together with a cold tongue in the southern North Atlantic, a cold anomaly develops in the Labrador Sea (southwest of Greenland) at lag 0 years (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f1">Fig. 1e</a>) before intensifying and extending eastwards into the Atlantic at lags <span class="mb">+</span>1 and <span class="mb">+</span>2 years (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f1">Fig. 1f,g</a>). Simultaneously, a warm anomaly strengthens and extends progressively eastward from the middle West Atlantic. As mentioned before, the sea surface temperature cold–warm–cold tripolar pattern<sup><a href="#ref19" title="Visbeck, M. et al. in The North Atlantic Oscillation eds Hurrell J., Kushnir Y., Ottersen G., Visbeck M. American Geophysical Union monograph (2003)." id="ref-link-32">19</a></sup> is a typical North Atlantic response to the positive phase of the NAO. This sea surface temperature anomaly, which persists and strengthens over consecutive years, provides a positive feedback onto the atmosphere leading to the lagged and amplified NAO response (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>). Although slightly weaker, the NAO response to the 11-year solar cycle simulated in our model is consistent with reanalysis (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>).</p>

	<h2>NAO and solar quasi-decadal variability</h2><p>To assess the influence of solar forcing on the NAO temporal variability, we examined wintertime NAO indices of both experiments with regard to the solar radio flux at 10.7<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>cm (or F10.7 index), which is a measure of solar ultraviolet activity (see the Methods section and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4a–d</a> for details on NAO indices calculation). NAO indices reveal a strong quasi-decadal mode of variability for each experiment as demonstrated by their respective power spectra (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4e,f</a>). This emphasizes that even in the absence of solar variations, an internal quasi-decadal variability mode of the NAO is generated in our model. The comparison of NAO indices spectral properties between the model (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>) and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5</a>) shows peaks, centred at 11 and 9 years, respectively, of similar quasi-decadal power spectral density supporting the realistic nature of the NAO quasi-decadal variability in our model experiments. The quasi-decadal band-pass filtered NAO indices (range 9-13 years; <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4e,f</a>) show that for the SOL experiment, the NAO index maxima lag the solar maxima in a coherent manner (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>), while for the NO_SOL experiment, the period of this oscillation is not constant over decades. The coherence between the filtered NAO index and the solar variability in the SOL experiment is reinforced by the lagged correlation of both time series, which produces statistically significant correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.61 at lag <span class="mb">+</span>1 and <span class="mb">+</span>2 years, respectively (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f2">Fig. 2b</a>). The spectral coherence between the unfiltered SOL NAO and the F10.7<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>cm time series also indicates a maximum value of 0.72 around a period of 11 years, which is statistically significant at the 95<span class="mb">%</span> confidence level (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4e</a>), whereas no significant spectral coherence is found at decadal time scales between the unfiltered NO_SOL NAO and the F10.7 indices (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4f</a>).</p>

	<p>In the NO_SOL experiment, the analysis of correlation between the filtered NAO index and the F10.7 revealed that the highest coefficient between lags −5 and <span class="mb">+</span>5 years is 0.49 (at lag −3 years) and 0.55 when spanning all possible lags (from −140 to <span class="mb">+</span>140 years). Despite the strong NAO quasi-decadal oscillation, the correlation between the filtered NAO index and the F10.7 is thus never as high as for the SOL case. Using a nonparametric random phase method<sup><a href="#ref27" title="Ebisuzaki, W. A. Method to estimate the statistical significance of a correlation when the data are serially correlated. J. Clim. 10, 2147-2153 (1997)." id="ref-link-33">27</a></sup> (see the Methods section for details), we additionally estimated the probability that the correlation coefficient between the filtered NO_SOL NAO and the F10.7 time series is higher than between the filtered SOL NAO and F10.7. We found that this chance is &lt;1<span class="mb">%</span> at the lags when maximum positive (<span class="mb">+</span>1 and <span class="mb">+</span>2) and negative (−4) correlation coefficient are recorded between the filtered SOL NAO and the F10.7 time series (coloured stripes in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f2">Fig. 2b</a>). This parallel analysis of the filtered NAO index of both experiments regarding the F10.7 suggests thus that the 11-year solar cycle impacts the North Atlantic climate by synchronizing the internal quasi-decadal variability mode of the NAO simulated by CESM-WACCM (see also <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>).</p><h2>Stratosphere dynamical analyses</h2><p>We investigate the proposed synchronization further by comparing the stratospheric response of both experiments with respect to the quasi-decadal NAO. Hence, instead of using 11-year solar cycle composite differences, the analysis that follows is performed by examining the differences between the maximum positive and negative phases of the NAO at quasi-decadal time scales (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>; Methods). In the SOL experiment, a statistically significant warming with a maximum of 0.9<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>K is observed near the tropical stratopause (3–1<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa<span class="mb">≈</span>45–50<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>km) at lag −1 year of the NAO-based composites (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). This positive temperature anomaly arises from increased solar ultraviolet irradiance during solar cycle maximum phases, which leads to additional heating due to ozone absorption in the upper stratosphere and more ozone production in the mid and upper stratosphere through the photolysis of oxygen<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Haigh, J. D. The role of stratospheric ozone in modulating the solar radiative forcing of climate. Nature 370, 544-546 (1994)." id="ref-link-34">28</a></sup>. A secondary warming anomaly of 0.8<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>K appears in the lower equatorial stratosphere (~70<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa or 20–25<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>km). Although less well understood than the direct upper stratospheric response, this secondary warming could arise from adiabatic warming<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Kodera, K. &amp; Kuroda, Y. Dynamical response to the solar cycle. J. Geophys. Res. 107, 4749 (2002)." id="ref-link-35">13</a></sup> combined with increased ozone heating<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Gray, L. J., Rumbold, S. T. &amp; Shine, K. P. Stratospheric temperature and radiative forcing response to 11[hyphen]year solar cycle changes in irradiance and ozone. J. Atmos. Sci. 66, 2402-2417 (2009)." id="ref-link-36">29</a></sup> due to a deceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. The two temperature responses to the 11-year solar cycle are in reasonable agreement with reanalyses<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Frame, T. H. A. &amp; Gray, L. J.

Signature of naturally induced variability in the atmosphere using multiple reanalysis datasets. Q. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc doi:10.1002/qj.2492 (2015)." id="ref-link-38">31</a></sup>. Consistent with the 11-year solar cycle/NAO lagged relationship (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f1">Figs 1</a> and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f2">2</a>), the maximum temperature response in the stratosphere due to 11-year solar variability leads the NAO by 1 year. Conversely, none of these typical solar signals is observed in the NO_SOL experiment which instead shows a seesaw of positive (negative) temperature anomalies in the middle tropical and subtropical stratosphere (20–3<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa) in winter (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Fig. 3b</a>).</p>

	<p>In the stratopause region, the 11-year solar cycle induced increase of the poleward temperature gradient results in a strengthening of the subtropical westerly jet through thermal wind balance<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Kodera, K. &amp; Kuroda, Y. Dynamical response to the solar cycle. J. Geophys. Res. 107, 4749 (2002)." id="ref-link-39">13</a></sup>. Changes in the zonal background flow alter planetary wave propagation so that the initial westerly wind anomalies amplify and propagate poleward and downward through the winter season<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Kodera, K. &amp; Kuroda, Y. Dynamical response to the solar cycle. J. Geophys. Res. 107, 4749 (2002)." id="ref-link-40">13</a></sup>. This mechanism leads to a deceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and a strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex at solar maxima. In the SOL experiment, NAO-based composite differences at lag −1 year show statistically significant westerly wind anomalies in the subtropical upper stratosphere (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Fig. 3c</a>), &gt;2<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>m<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>s<sup>−1</sup>, and in polar latitudes, extending down to the Earth’s surface. This results in a stronger polar night jet throughout the depth of the polar stratosphere (60–80° N, 200–3<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa) of &gt;4<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>m<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>s<sup>−1</sup> at its maximum. As the signal propagates down to the troposphere, it slightly moves equatorward (50–70° N) projecting onto an AO/NAO-positive phase as revealed by easterly (westerly) anomalies centred at 30° N (60° N). The NO_SOL experiment shows a very similar—although weaker—zonal mean zonal wind response in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Fig. 3d</a>), as shown by the easterly (westerly) wind anomalies at 30° N (55° N), consistent with the AO/NAO-positive phase. The statistically significant westerlies extend up to the lower/middle stratosphere (~40<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa) but easterlies are found at higher levels up to the mesosphere (above 1<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa). Strong westerly wind anomalies are also confined to the subtropical stratopause region (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Fig. 3d</a>, 30° N, 3<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa). Thus, in the absence of 11-year solar cycle forcing, the quasi-decadal tropospheric/lower stratospheric zonal wind is certainly linked to the AO/NAO variability, but is not related to the middle and upper stratosphere as it is in the case when solar forcing variability is included.</p><p>Planetary wave propagation and wave–mean flow interaction anomalies are examined using NAO-based composite differences of the Eliassen–Palm flux (EPF) vector and its divergence<sup><a href="#ref32" title="Andrews, D. G., Holton, J. R. &amp; Leovy, C. B. Middle Atmosphere Dynamics 489 (Academic Press (1987)." id="ref-link-41">32</a></sup> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4a,b</a>). We recall that an anomalous divergence of EPF (or positive anomaly) leads to a reduced wave drag and thus a relative strengthening of westerlies. In both experiments, anomalous poleward wave refraction is observed in the vicinity of the subtropical stratopause region, leading to a statistically significant positive EPF divergence (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4a,b</a>). This statistically significant anomaly expands poleward to 70° N in the ‘SOL’ experiment (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>), consistent with westerly wind anomalies in the upper high-latitude stratosphere (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Fig. 3c</a>). In the middle polar stratosphere (60–80° N, 100–10<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa), the strengthening of the polar night jet (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Fig. 3c</a>) is consistent with a reduced upward planetary wave propagation and the associated westerly forcing anomaly (that is, positive EPF divergence; <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). Note that for the SOL experiment, the zonal mean zonal wind and EPF divergence winter signals in the stratosphere associated with solar maximum minus minimum at lag −1 year of the NAO-based composites (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f3">Figs 3c</a> and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">4a</a>) compare favourably with those obtained by Ineson <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref11" title="Ineson, S. et al. Solar forcing of winter climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere. Nat. Geosci. 4, 753-757 (2011)." id="ref-link-42">11</a></sup> (see <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4</a> in ref. <a href="#ref11" title="Ineson, S. et al. Solar forcing of winter climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere. Nat. Geosci. 4, 753-757 (2011)." id="ref-link-43">11</a>; signs are inverted as they examine solar minimum minus maximum). Conversely, no statistically significant signal is observed for the NO_SOL experiment in the polar night jet region (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). In the upper mid-latitude troposphere, both experiments exhibit a strong EPF divergence positive anomaly (35–60° N; 400–200<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa) associated with the positive AO/NAO signal. This signal is further amplified and expands poleward and upward when solar forcing variability is included (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>).</p>

	<p>The annual evolution of the December to February NAO-based lagged composite differences of the mean wave forcing anomalies in the three key regions previously identified (see boxes in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>) shows a clear statistically significant and continuous quasi-decadal oscillation in the SOL experiment (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4c</a>), which maximizes (minimizes) at solar maximum (minimum). Notice that the continuous interannual time evolution of the zonal mean zonal wind and wave–mean flow interaction anomalies is also visible on lagged latitude-pressure cross-sections (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Figs 7 and 8</a>). For the NO_SOL experiment (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150915/ncomms9268/full/ncomms9268.html#f4">Fig. 4d</a>), wave forcing anomalies display a statistically significant quasi-decadal oscillation in the mid-latitude upper troposphere only, corresponding to the AO/NAO variability. The amplitude of the signal is also two times lower than in the SOL experiment. The comparison of stratospheric dynamical signals in both experiments shows that including the 11-year solar cycle leads to a stratosphere ‘top–down’ influence on the tropospheric circulation that could explain the synchronization of the NAO at quasi-decadal time scales.</p>
