reasons is the loss of sea ice in the region. As Arctic sea ice&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>Scientists have linked the rapidly-warming&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Analysing air temperature records from 1979 to&#13;
2014, the researchers found that when conditions over the&#13;
Barents-Kara Sea region were warmer than usual, East Asia tended to&#13;
experience a cold winter. This link has also been identified&#13;

<span>other scientists</span></a><span>.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The new study also finds that&#13;
higher-than-average temperatures over the East Siberian-Chukchi Sea&#13;
region were often followed by severe winters in North&#13;
America.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>This has been the situation over</span> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/02/20/winter-weather-cold-snow-record-temperatures/23728379/">&#13;

<span>Canada</span></a> <span>for the past two winters, says</span>&#13;
<a href="http://marine.rutgers.edu/~francis/"><span>Prof Jennifer&#13;
Francis</span></a> <span>from Rutgers University. Francis wasn't&#13;
involved in this study, but has been actively involved in research&#13;
into whether Arctic warming is affecting weather&#13;
elsewhere.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Big step forward</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>So how do warm conditions in these particular&#13;
areas of the Arctic cast a chill all the way over in Asia and&#13;
America? Similarly to other</span> <a href="/blog/2015/01/scientists-discuss-how-strongly-a-warming-arctic-is-implicated-in-extreme-weather/">&#13;
<span>studies</span></a><span>, the researchers point the finger at&#13;
the</span> <a href="http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/the-uks-wet-summer-the-jet-stream-and-climate-change/">&#13;
<span>jet stream</span></a> <span>- a river of high-speed winds&#13;
flowing west to east high up in the atmosphere.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The jet stream is driven by the temperature&#13;
difference between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes. As the Arctic&#13;
warms, the temperature difference decreases, weakening the jet&#13;
stream, Francis explains to Carbon Brief:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"[The researchers] find&#13;
that bulges in the upper atmosphere - indicative of large northward&#13;
swings in the jet stream - occur in tandem with the regional Arctic&#13;
warming."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>These wavy patterns of the jet stream draw cold&#13;
air from the Arctic over North America and East Asia. This also&#13;
leads to a greater number of high pressure "blocking" weather&#13;
systems, so the cold conditions can stay put for much of the&#13;
winter.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The new paper will help settle the debate over&#13;
whether Arctic warming is affecting mid-latitude weather, Francis&#13;
says:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"The new study takes a&#13;
big step toward clarifying a controversial and important issue:&#13;
whether and how rapid Arctic warming and the disappearance of sea&#13;
ice are contributing to increased weather extremes in lower&#13;
latitudes."</span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Seasonal forecasting</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Arctic warming isn't the only factor affecting&#13;
how severe these winters are, the researchers point out. But as&#13;
seasonal predictions of extreme winters are currently quite hit and&#13;
miss, the results could help improve forecasts in the&#13;
short-term.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The researchers found that severe winter weather&#13;
in East Asia followed around 15 days after the warm conditions&#13;
appeared in the Barents and Kara Seas. For North America, the cold&#13;
conditions hit around 5 days after the unusually warm conditions in&#13;
the East Siberian and Chukchi Seas.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Being forewarned about oncoming cold weather&#13;
could help people to prepare for the oncoming weather, says&#13;
Francis:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"As we watch the Arctic&#13;
continue to warm and melt - with regional differences from one year&#13;
to the next - the research presented by Kug et al may provide early&#13;
warning of extreme winter weather in heavily populated areas of the&#13;
northern hemisphere, thereby saving energy and lives."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>But we shouldn't rely on these findings too&#13;
heavily for longer-term projections, says</span> <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/js546"><span>Dr&#13;
James Screen</span></a><span>, from the University of Exeter, who&#13;
leads a three-year project on the impacts of Arctic&#13;
warming.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Screen says scientists should use the results&#13;
with caution when trying to understand how a warming Arctic will&#13;
affect our climate through the 21st century. We can expect sea ice&#13;
to be lost from across the whole Arctic, rather than in specific&#13;
areas, he tells Carbon Brief:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"The response to the&#13;
overall loss of ice may be different to that in response to loss in&#13;
specific geographical regions."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the longer-term,</span> <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00185.1">&#13;
<span>research</span></a> <span>by Screen suggests that as global&#13;
temperatures rise, the risk of severe winters North America is&#13;
likely to fall, not rise, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to&#13;
be high. So as the Arctic continues to warm, and sea ice continues&#13;
to melt, we can't expect its influence on mid-latitude weather to&#13;
stay the same.</span></p>&#13;
