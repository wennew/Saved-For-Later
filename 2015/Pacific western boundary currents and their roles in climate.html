													<p><b>a</b>, Schematic of major currents and observed surface wind vectors (orange dashed lines) and wind stress curl (shading: positive curl in red; negative in blue). The Intertropical Convergence Zone and the South Pacific Convergence Zone are indicated by thick grey-dashed lines. Red and blue shading in the Southern Hemisphere corresponds to anticyclonic and cyclonic curls, respectively, and vice versa in the Northern Hemisphere. <b>b</b>, Pacific zonally averaged zonal wind stress (grey curve) and wind stress curl (red curve) for the present day (solid lines) and the latter half of the twenty-first century (dashed lines). Projected changes are calculated as the multi-model mean difference between 2050–2100 future winds under RCP8.5 and 1900–2000 historical winds.

Depths shallower than 2,000 m are colour-shaded. Grey shading indicates depths shallower than 50 m. The main currents, integrated from 1,000 m to the surface, are indicated by light blue arrows; the red curved arrow indicates the ‘freshwater plug’; red straight arrows indicate the main surface-trapped counter currents; purple arrows indicate undercurrents; question mark indicates uncertainty in flow path.
