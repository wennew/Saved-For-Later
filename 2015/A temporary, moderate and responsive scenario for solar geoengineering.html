									<p>The risks and benefits of solar geoengineering, or solar radiation management (SRM), depend on assumptions about its implementation. Claims that SRM will reduce precipitation, increase ocean acidification or deplete stratospheric ozone, or that it must be continued forever once started, are not inherent features of SRM; rather, they are features of common scenarios for its implementation. Most analyses assume, for example, that SRM would be used to stop the increase in global temperature or restore temperature to pre-industrial values. We argue that these are poor scenario choices on which to base policy-relevant judgements about SRM. As a basis for further analysis, we provide a scenario that is temporary in that its end point is zero SRM, is moderate in that it offsets only half of the growth in anthropogenic climate forcing and is responsive in that it recognizes that the amount of SRM will be adjusted in light of new information.</p>

													<p>The top panel shows the total radiative forcing for RCP4.5, and a radiative forcing profile in which the rate of change is halved starting in 2020; that is, for year <i>k</i>, RF<sub>new</sub>(2020 + <i>k</i>) = RF<sub>RCP4.5</sub>(2020 + <i>k</i>/2). The difference between these gives the suggested initial SRM profile in the second panel. The effect on global mean temperature as predicted by MAGICC (with a 3 °C climate sensitivity) is shown in the third panel, and the corresponding decadal rates of change in the final panel. Note that temperature and its rate of change would depend on climate sensitivity, but the amount of SRM would not. If rate-independent climate impacts increase superlinearly, then the benefits will be larger than is evident in the third panel. If impacts are quadratic in temperature, then impacts will be reduced by 20% in 2070 (roughly the time when SRM radiative forcing peaks) although the temperature increase Δ<i>T</i> is only reduced by 10%.

													<p>Examples of the benefits and harms of SRM (left and right panels respectively) illustrating that benefits increase sublinearly and harms increase superlinearly. Whatever weighting is used to aggregate benefits and harms, the amount of SRM that maximizes the sum of benefits and harms will be less — perhaps much less — than the amount of SRM that maximizes benefits. The left panel shows a rough proxy for local climate damages, specifically the <i>y</i>-axis is the reduction in the sum of the mean of the quadratic deviation of temperature and precipitation across all climate model grid-points, where the deviation of each variable from its pre-industrial value is normalized by its interannual standard deviation. The climate model is HadCM3L (ref. <a href="/nclimate/journal/v5/n3/full/nclimate2493.html#ref31" title="Jones, C. A fast ocean GCM without flux adjustments. J. Atm.
