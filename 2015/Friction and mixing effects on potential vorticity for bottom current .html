We argue that bottom current vorticity is prone to significant sign changes
and oscillations due to topographic effects when, in particular, the current
flows over the sill of a channel. These vorticity variations are, however,
modulated by frictional effects due to seafloor roughness and morphology.
Such behavior is also reflected in the PV spatial evolution, which shows an
abrupt peak around the sill region. Our diagnoses on vorticity and PV allow
us to obtain general insights about the effect of mixing and friction on the
pathway and internal structure of bottom-trapped currents flowing through
channels and straits, and to discuss spatial variability of the frictional
coefficient. Our approach significantly differs from other PV-constant
approaches previously used in studying the dynamics of bottom currents
flowing through rotating channels.
