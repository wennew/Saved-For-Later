		<div><p>Another month has passed and so here is the updated Arctic sea ice volume <a target="_self" href="http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAnomalyCurrentV2_CY.png?%3C?php%20echo%20time%28%29?">graph</a> as calculated by the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) at the <a target="_self" href="http://psc.apl.washington.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/">Polar Science Center</a>:</p>

<p>Just like <a target="_self" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/piomas-june-2015.html">last month</a> the 2015 trend line has increased the gap with pre-2010 years, with the exception of 2007. It has also crept closer to 2014 (difference now 631 km3, down from 1208 km3 last month), but the difference with 2013 has increased by 225 km3 to 1223 km3. According to the model the difference in volume with top 3 years 2010, 2011 and 2012 has grown by 538, 333 and 1063 km3 respectively. As of the end of June there is 2968 km3 more ice than at the end of June 2012.</p>
<p>The differences are more clearly visible on <a target="_self" href="http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,119.msg1562.html#msg1562">Wipneus'</a> PIOMAS volume graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7abaf3d970b-pi"><img title="Piomas-trnd4" alt="Piomas-trnd4" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7abaf3d970b-800wi" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The change in differences makes sense as 2015 was slightly warmer during June than rebound years 2013 and 2014, but the temperatures and atmospheric conditions can't be compared to those of years like 2011 and 2012 (I'll have another detailed comparison of these conditions in an upcoming post on melt ponds during June). Sea ice extent decrease also slowed down big time during June, which could be another factor in how the volume numbers compare to those of previous years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the trend line on the PIOMAS sea ice volume anomaly graph has now dipped below the linear trend again:</p>
<p><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7abb03e970b-pi"><img title="BPIOMASIceVolumeAnomalyCurrentV2.1" alt="BPIOMASIceVolumeAnomalyCurrentV2.1" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7abb03e970b-800wi" border="0"></a></p>
<p>After crudely calculating the ice pack's average thickness by dividing PIOMAS volume numbers with Cryosphere Today sea ice area numbers, it seems this year's trend line is still following 2009:<a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1352275970c-pi"><img title="PICT20150630" alt="PICT20150630" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1352275970c-800wi" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The Polar Science Center thickness graph is basically showing the same thing:</p>
<p><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d13522d0970c-pi"><img title="Bpiomas_plot_daily_heff.2sst" alt="Bpiomas_plot_daily_heff.2sst" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d13522d0970c-800wi" border="0"></a></p>
<p>It's going to be interesting to see what will happen to the volume numbers this month, as the current melting season is only now changing gears and the thicker ice in the Central Arctic Basin and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas is experiencing a massive heat wave (relatively speaking, see latest <a target="_self" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/07/asi-2015-update-4-massive-heat.html">ASI update</a>), leading to a fragmented ice pack full of melt ponds.</p>
<p>Added to that this map produced by <a target="_self" href="http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,119.msg55418.html#msg55418">Wipneus</a> indicates that there is quite a bit of easy ice left in Hudson and Baffin Bay:</p>
<p><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d135252c970c-pi"><img title="Index.php" alt="Index.php" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d135252c970c-800wi" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Cashing in this piggy bank ice should also increase/reduce differences with other years in which this ice had already melted out.</p>
<p>It all depends on the weather in the coming weeks, of course, but according to the forecasts anomalously warm temperatures and clear skies are persisting in the short term, and so I wouldn't be surprised if 2015 overtakes 2014 (which lost incredibly little volume during July), comes closer to 2013 and starts closing that enormous gap with 2012.</p>
<p>For more details, graphs and analysis I highly recommend Wipneus' <a target="_self" href="https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,119.msg53274.html#msg53274">PIOMAS thread</a> on the Arctic Sea Ice Forum.</p></div>
