Introduction</h2><p class="svArticle section" id="para0005">The fundamental dynamical equations for the ocean can typically be cast into a flux form in which changes to physical quantities depend upon the divergence of their flux. This reflects the existence of integral conservation laws and yields a natural physical interpretation in terms of the transport of properties such as heat, salinity, or potential vorticity from one region of the ocean to another. However, in practice, the direct analysis of the dynamical impact of oceanic fluxes is often obscured by the existence of large <em>non-divergent</em> flux components, which necessarily have no direct dynamical effect. The general resolution of this issue is through the application a Helmholtz decomposition, separating the flux into a divergent component, which is dynamically active, and a non-divergent component, which is dynamically inert. Unfortunately, this decomposition is inherently non-unique in bounded domains, and is dependent upon a choice of boundary conditions ( <span id="bbib0018"><a href="#bib0018" id="ancbbib0018" class="intra_ref">Fox-Kemper et al., 2003</a></span>).</p><p class="svArticle section" id="para0006">This issue is of particular concern in the analysis and comparison of eddy parameterisations, which typically specify parameterised eddy fluxes. For example, the existence of locally up-gradient fluxes does not necessarily rule out the application of down-gradient flux parameterisations – an appropriately defined divergent eddy flux may be more closely aligned counter to the mean gradients (e.g. <span id="bbib0038"><a href="#bib0038" id="ancbbib0038" class="intra_ref">Marshall and Shutts, 1981</a></span>). Similarly, down-gradient potential vorticity closures violate momentum conservation constraints in general (<a href="#bib0011" id="bbib0011" class="intra_ref">Bretherton, 1966</a> and <a href="#bib0036" id="bbib0036" class="intra_ref">Marshall, Maddison, Berloff, 2012</a>), but momentum conservation can be restored via the introduction of an appropriate non-divergent eddy potential vorticity flux (<span id="bbib0016"><a href="#bib0016" id="ancbbib0016" class="intra_ref">Eden, 2010</a></span>).</p><p class="svArticle section" id="para0007">In a domain average sense, eddy potential vorticity fluxes must be oriented down the mean gradient in order to ensure net generation of eddy enstrophy, itself required in order to balance small-scale enstrophy dissipation. However it has long been recognised that this principle need not hold locally (<a href="#bib0023" id="bbib0023" class="intra_ref">Harrison, 1978</a> and <a href="#bib0025" id="bbib0025" class="intra_ref">Holland, Rhines, 1980</a>). Local fluxes of eddy enstrophy permit the eddy potential vorticity flux to be oriented in any direction. In <span id="bbib0038"><a href="#bib0038" id="ancbbib0038" class="intra_ref">Marshall and Shutts (1981)</a></span> eddy fluxes are separated into a component balancing the mean advection and a residual component. In the barotropic vorticity model of <span id="bbib0039"><a href="#bib0039" id="ancbbib0039" class="intra_ref">Marshall (1984)</a></span> it is found that the residual eddy potential vorticity flux thus defined is more strongly aligned with the mean potential vorticity gradient. The methodology is directly generalised in <span id="bbib0043"><a href="#bib0043" id="ancbbib0043" class="intra_ref">Nakamura (1998)</a></span> and <span id="bbib0044"><a href="#bib0044" id="ancbbib0044" class="intra_ref">Nakamura and Chao (2002)</a></span>. A related approach is described in <span id="bbib0019"><a href="#bib0019" id="ancbbib0019" class="intra_ref">Greatbatch (2001)</a></span> and <span id="bbib0042"><a href="#bib0042" id="ancbbib0042" class="intra_ref">Medvedev and Greatbatch (2004)</a></span>, whereby the eddy fluxes are separated into advective, diffusive, and rotational fluxes, which are then related to the components of the total (mean plus eddy) advective eddy variance flux in the along and across mean gradient directions. This results in a decomposition similar to the Temporal Residual Mean I formulation of <span id="bbib0040"><a href="#bib0040" id="ancbbib0040" class="intra_ref">McDougall and McIntosh (1996)</a></span> (with the latter replacing the use of the total advective eddy variance flux with the mean advective eddy variance flux – see <span id="bbib0035"><a href="#bib0035" id="ancbbib0035" class="intra_ref">Maddison and Marshall (2013</a></span>, <span id="bsec0016"><a href="#sec0016" id="ancbsec0016" class="intra_ref">Appendix B</a></span>) for further details). The decomposition of <span id="bbib0042"><a href="#bib0042" id="ancbbib0042" class="intra_ref">Medvedev and Greatbatch (2004)</a></span> is itself generalised in <span id="bbib0017"><a href="#bib0017" id="ancbbib0017" class="intra_ref">Eden et al. (2007)</a></span> via the consideration of higher order eddy budgets.</p><p class="svArticle section" id="para0008">An alternative approach is to decompose eddy potential vorticity fluxes into rotational and divergent components via the use of a Helmholtz decomposition (e.g. <span id="bbib0031"><a href="#bib0031" id="ancbbib0031" class="intra_ref">Lau and Wallace, 1979</a></span>). In <span id="bbib0049"><a href="#bib0049" id="ancbbib0049" class="intra_ref">Roberts and Marshall (2000)</a></span> ocean eddy fluxes, diagnosed from a primitive equation model, are decomposed into rotational and divergent components via the application of a Helmholtz decomposition, subject to zero normal divergent flux boundary conditions. The resulting divergent eddy fluxes are in this case found to be rather poorly correlated with corresponding mean gradients.</p><p class="svArticle section" id="para0009">Non-uniquness of the Helmholtz decomposition in bounded domains, and consequences for the decomposition of eddy fluxes, is discussed at length in <span id="bbib0018"><a href="#bib0018" id="ancbbib0018" class="intra_ref">Fox-Kemper et al. (2003)</a></span>. The zero normal divergent flux boundary condition is only one of countless valid options. Subject to an alternative choice of boundary conditions it is possible, in a bounded domain, to extract an eddy flux which has a minimum norm, or a minimum deviation from the mean gradient (<span id="bbib0018"><a href="#bib0018" id="ancbbib0018" class="intra_ref">Fox-Kemper et al., 2003</a></span>). Without any additional constraints on the problem there is no way to select a boundary condition from amongst these options.</p><p class="svArticle section" id="para0010">This article discusses a physically motivated approach for resolving this ambiguity in the Helmholtz decomposition of eddy potential vorticity fluxes. Specifically the quasi-geostrophic residual-mean equations allow the identification of a one-to-one correspondence between divergent eddy potential vorticity fluxes and non-divergent eddy momentum tendencies. The definition of the latter leads to an unambiguous definition of the former, which leads to a unique divergent eddy potential vorticity flux which satisfies a zero tangential component boundary condition. In a simply connected domain the resulting divergent eddy potential vorticity flux satisfies a powerful optimality condition: it is the (horizontally oriented) divergent flux with minimum <em>L</em><sup>2</sup> norm. Hence there is a well-defined sense in which this approach removes as much of the dynamically inactive non-divergent eddy potential vorticity flux as possible, and extracts an underlying dynamically active divergent eddy potential vorticity flux. It is shown that this approach leads to a divergent eddy potential vorticity flux which has an intuitive physical interpretation, via a direct relationship to the resulting forcing of the mean circulation.</p><p class="svArticle section" id="para0011">The paper proceeds as follows. <span id="bsec0002"><a href="#sec0002" id="ancbsec0002" class="intra_ref">Section 2</a></span> describes the mathematical formulation. The quasi-geostrophic residual-mean equations are outlined, and the relationship between divergent potential vorticity fluxes and non-divergent momentum tendencies is described. A stream function tendency, or “force function”, is used to define the divergent potential vorticity fluxes, and it is shown that in a simply connected domain the resulting divergent potential vorticity flux satisfies an optimality property. Resulting divergent eddy potential vorticity fluxes are diagnosed from a three layer quasi-geostrophic model in <span id="bsec0008"><a href="#sec0008" id="ancbsec0008" class="intra_ref">Section 3</a></span>. The decomposition is compared against the more conventional use of zero normal divergent potential vorticity flux boundary conditions, and the utility for the assessment of eddy parameterisations is considered. The paper concludes in <span id="bsec0014"><a href="#sec0014" id="ancbsec0014" class="intra_ref">Section 4</a></span>.</p><p class="page_fragment_ind" data-id="frag_3"/></div>
