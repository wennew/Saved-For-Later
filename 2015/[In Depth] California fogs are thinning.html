                        turns drab and foggy, a phenomenon locals call "May Gray" and "June Gloom." But the low-hanging marine clouds responsible
                        for that gloom have declined dramatically over the past 60 years, a new study concludes. It fingers the growth of cities and
                        their heat-retaining concrete as a prime cause. The research, recently published online in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>, offers insight into how increasing urbanization may erode coastal fog banks in the future, with potentially serious consequences
                        for people and ecosystems. It's "the first definitive look at how fog might change for a specific coastal region," says Travis
