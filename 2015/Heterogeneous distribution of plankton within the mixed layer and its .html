					<p>Using the temporal succession of depth profiles we have illustrated the presence of patchiness in the vertical distribution of planktonic organisms within the ML. We have also shown how different mechanisms may act to shape the structure of planktonic communities at different layers within the ML, and how the appropriate conditions may trigger a bloom in these nutrient-poor waters within a few days.</p><h2>The central Red Sea seasonal bloom</h2><p>In many tropical marine ecosystems, like the Red Sea, phytoplankton growth in the euphotic layer is controlled primarily by the supply of nutrients (as light availability is high throughout the year). The Red Sea is considered a relatively oligotrophic basin (except the southern part)<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Raitsos, D. E., Pradhan, Y., Brewin, R. J. W., Stenchikov, S. &amp; Hoteit, I.

Although we do not have direct evidence of variations of the ML depth for 2012, it is accepted that changes in SST provide an indirect indication of vertical mixing, which may influence nutrient availability<sup><a href="#ref21" title="Goes, J. I., Saino, T., Ishizaka, J., Wong, C. S. &amp; Nojiri, Y. Estimating sea surface nitrate from space by compound remote sensing. Geophys. Res.

Remote sensing of chlorophyll has limitations especially in optically complex waters, where particulate and/or dissolved organic matter do not co-vary in a predictable manner with chlorophyll<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Morel, A. &amp; Gentili, B.

Therefore, chlorophyll data may be influenced (generally resulting in an overestimation) by the factors mentioned above, especially in the coastal waters and shallow reef-inhabited waters such as the Red Sea. However, not all the coastal high chlorophyll values are necessarily erroneous, as the large coral reef complexes may be sources of either nutrients or chlorophyll-rich detritus that enhance phytoplankton production near the reefs<sup><a href="#ref16" title="Acker, J., Leptoukh, G., Shen, S., Zhu, T. &amp; Kempler, S.

In fact, recent evidence clearly shows a significant relationship between satellite and <i>in situ</i> chloroplyll data in coral reef areas of the Red Sea<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Racault, M.-F. et al. Phytoplankton phenology indices and their significance for Red Sea coral reef ecosystems. Remote Sens. Environ. 160, 222–234, doi:10.1016/j.rse.2015.01.019.

The scope of this study is to investigate the regional seasonal succession and timing of phytoplankton blooms, regardless of the absolute chlorophyll concentrations.</p><h2>Major drivers of plankton vertical structures in the Red Sea</h2><p>The formation of biological thin layers due to physical processes or behavioural aggregations has been described in the literature <sup><a href="#ref23" title="Bjørnsen, P.

However, in our case, vertical segregation of non-migrating groups (prokaryotes, and protists) was evident in a physically uniform water body. What, then, are the mechanisms driving the formation of these vertical patches?</p><p>For motile mesozooplankton, ciliates and dinoflagellates, it is expected that their distribution will be influenced by behaviours such as foraging, avoiding predators, and so on. For organisms that actively control their buoyancy, such as diatoms, changes in their physiological rates due to, for instance, severe nutrient limitation would affect their vertical position in the water column<sup><a href="#ref27" title="Richardson, T. L. &amp; Cullen, J. J. Changes in buoyancy and chemical composition during growth of a coastal marine diatom: Ecological and biogeochemical consequences. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 128, 77–90 (1995)." id="ref-link-39">27</a></sup>. This phenomenon was evident in the gradual deepening of diatoms observed in the course of our study. As shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150611/srep11240/full/srep11240.html#t3">Table 3</a>, the diatoms in the deeper strata were apparently dying. Nutritional resources (either inorganic or organic nutrients for autotrophs and prokaryotes, or prey for heterotrophs) are, therefore, one of the relevant factors to consider. Our data indicate that nutrient limitation occurred first in the upper ML then progressed downwards. Nutrient concentration in the deeper part of the ML, albeit low, was still higher than in the upper ML. However, in the lower strata, light was limiting (&lt;1% surface PAR intensity) and compromising photosynthesis, which explains the negative phytoplankton growth rates (μ<sub>o</sub> based on chl <i>a</i>) there. Some researchers have reported actively growing autotrophs at even deeper depths and lower light conditions in other oligotrophic oceans. However, in those cases, the chl <i>a</i> maximum w<i>a</i>s located below the ML, and nutrient inputs from the deeper water most likely allowed the phytoplankton to endure light limitation<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Estrada, M. et al.

Given the deep thermocline in our study area, deep phytoplankton communities would likely not thrive under the combined stress of low light, low nutrients and high temperature.</p><p>Another important factor shaping the distribution of marine organisms is predation. We measured microzooplankton grazing on phytoplankton, and found different coupling between phytoplankton growth and grazing rates in different strata, with positive phytoplankton net growth rates in the upper ML. Vertical differences between phytoplankton growth rate and grazing mortality rate are also found in other studies, even within the ML<sup><a href="#ref6" title="Landry, M. R., Selph, K.

To our knowledge, this has never been considered as a driver of phytoplankton distribution within the ML. The highest phytoplankton concentrations in the chl <i>a</i> maximum layer differed little from that in the surrounding waters, and could be easily attained in 24 h based on the observed phytoplankton growth and mortality rates.</p><p>The mesozooplankton community was dominated by copepods and appendicularians (<a href="/srep/2015/150611/srep11240/full/srep11240.html#t1">Table 1</a>).

However, appendicularians can retain picoplankton and, with maximum filtration rates that may clear the water column on a daily basis<sup><a href="#ref34" title="Acuña, J. L. &amp; Kiefer, M.

Appendicularians may position themselves in the water column to maximise encounter rates with their prey and thus benefit from patchy environments<sup><a href="#ref36" title="Tiselius, P.

This behaviour would imply that their grazing activities would over time reduce patchiness of their prey (i.e., the “killing the winner” hypothesis<sup><a href="#ref38" title="Thingstad, T. F., Bratbak, G. &amp; Heldal, M. Bacteriophage Ecology [ Abedon, S. T. (ed.)] [251–280] (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008)." id="ref-link-52">38</a></sup>). Therefore, the actual potential for patch-formation by the winter microbial community in the central Red Sea should be much stronger than the one observed in this study.</p><h2>Potential for bloom formation</h2><p>During the six-day incubation, chl <i>a</i> concentration increased 9 times to 4.5 μg chl <i>a</i> L<sup>−1</sup> in bottles amended with deep water and the corresponding net growth rate was ca. 0.5 d<sup>−1</sup>. Hence, under a hypothetical mixing event with nutrient-rich waters from below the thermocline, our results suggest that a phytoplankton bloom can develop rapidly. The observed phytoplankton growth rates were both in the range of the net growth rates found for phytoplankton at 20 m in our first dilution grazing experiments (coinciding with the microcosm experiment) and in accordance with recent meta-analyses of microzooplankton grazing rates in the oceans<sup><a href="#ref39" title="Schmoker, C., Hernandez-Leon, S. &amp; Calbet, A. Microzooplankton grazing in the oceans: impacts, data variability, knowledge gaps and future directions. J. Plankton Res. 35, 691–706, doi:10.1093/plankt/fbt023 (2013)." id="ref-link-53">39</a></sup>, but were much higher than the rates obtained by satellite data of the actual bloom in the area. This discrepancy may be due to several reasons: Firstly, we mixed equal amounts of deep nutrient-rich water with ML water in a short period of time, which does not mimic the natural mixing process that lasts some days and is more gradual. Secondly, we removed larger than 50 μm grazers, who could be crucial for regulating phytoplankton growth and bloom development.</p><p>Several conventional bloom formation theories have been discussed in the literature. According to Sverdrup’s critical depth hypothesis (CDH)<sup><a href="#ref2" title="Sverdrup, H. U. On conditions for the vernal blooming of phytoplankton. J. Cons. int. Explor. Mer. 18, 287–295 (1953)." id="ref-link-54">2</a></sup>, spring-time increase in irradiance and shoaling of the ML provide favourable conditions for phytoplankton bloom development. The CDH assumes even distribution of organisms within the ML and non-limiting nutrients, which evidently is not true for the central Red Sea. The critical turbulence hypothesis (CTH)<sup><a href="#ref40" title="Huisman, J., Oostveen, P. v. &amp; Weissing, F. J. Critical depth and critical turbulence: Two different mechanisms for the development of phytoplankton blooms. Limnol. Oceanogr 44, 1781–1787 (1999)." id="ref-link-55">40</a></sup> offers an alternative explanation of bloom formation even in the absence of vertical stratification, but it assumes a constant grazing mortality of phytoplankton within the ML, which also is inconsistent with observations<sup><a href="#ref6" title="Landry, M. R., Selph, K. E. &amp; Yang, E. J. Decoupled phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing in the deep euphotic zone of the eastern equatorial Pacific. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 421, 13–24 (2011)." id="ref-link-56">6</a></sup><sup>, (this study)</sup>. More recently, the disturbance-recovery hypothesis (DRH)<sup><a href="#ref41" title="Behrenfeld, M. J., Doney, S.

The central Red Sea does not seem to follow this pattern because the bloom usually occurs when the thermocline is deepening<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Raitsos, D. E., Pradhan, Y., Brewin, R. J.

We propose that patchiness of organisms may persist in the winter ML and the dilution effect of the deepening of the ML is irrelevant for these environments. To the contrary, deepening ML entrains any deep chl <i>a</i> from below it. Under these conditions, bloom may occur at any time, as long as there is enough water column stability, nutrients and light to allow the accumulation of organisms. Once a critical seed population is reached, any further mixing will fertilise the ML with nutrients to generate a bloom.
