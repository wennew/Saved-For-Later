					<p>We show how much of the year-to-year variability in crop yields was associated with climate variability within and across regions. As the demand for crops increases globally<sup><a href="#ref19" title="Foley, J. A. et al. Solutions for a cultivated planet. Nature 478, 337–342 (2011)." id="ref-link-39">19</a></sup> and productivity gains fail to keep pace with projected demands<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Ray, D. K., Mueller, N. D., West, P. C. &amp; Foley, J. A. Crop yield trends are insufficient to double global food production by 2050. PLoS. ONE 8, e66428 (2013)." id="ref-link-40">12</a></sup>, ensuring the stability of national food supplies and farmer livelihoods to variable production will be even more important. Low global food stocks in conjunction with fluctuation in agricultural production can, in particular, contribute to food price spikes<sup><a href="#ref20" title="Piesse, J. &amp; Thirtle, C. Three bubbles and a panic: An explanatory review of recent food commodity price events. Food Policy 34, 119–129 (2009)." id="ref-link-41">20</a>, <a href="#ref21" title="Wright, B. D. The economics of grain price volatility. Appl. Econ. Perspect. Policy 33, 32–58 (2011)." id="ref-link-42">21</a></sup>. Regions with high crop yield variability would disproportionately contribute to this effect especially if they are also the major breadbaskets of the world<sup><a href="#ref20" title="Piesse, J. &amp; Thirtle, C. Three bubbles and a panic: An explanatory review of recent food commodity price events. Food Policy 34, 119–129 (2009)." id="ref-link-43">20</a>, <a href="#ref21" title="Wright, B. D. The economics of grain price volatility. Appl. Econ. Perspect. Policy 33, 32–58 (2011)." id="ref-link-44">21</a></sup>. Even in regions with comparatively lower yields, fluctuations in crop production may impact the local food security. Our study is unique in giving a global spatially detailed account of where and by how much crop yields have varied and how much of this was driven by climate variability.</p><p>We found that there were numerous regions where climate variability explained more than 60% of the yield variability in maize, rice, wheat and soybean (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms6989/full/ncomms6989.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Many of these regions were in the most productive global areas such as Midwestern U.S. and the Chinese Corn Belt for maize, and Western Europe and Australia for wheat.</p><p>Our study identifies unique spatial patterns in the effects of temperature and/or precipitation variability on yields—for example, rice and wheat in India (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms6989/full/ncomms6989.html#f3">Fig. 3b,c</a>) as well as maize and soybean in the United States (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms6989/full/ncomms6989.html#f3">Fig. 3a,d</a>). Our simple classification of the prevailing relationships between climate and crop yields enables digging deeper into trends for particular regions. While relatively high resolution compared with past research our results are constrained by the resolution of the data, which is at the political unit and monthly climate data. Within political units, at specific field/subnational locations, the climate variability impact could be higher or lower.</p><p>The 32–39% of the yield variability explained by climate variability translates into large fluctuations in global crop production. For example, ~39% of the maize yield variability of 0.6 tons/ha/year explained by climate variability over 94 million ha translates into an annual fluctuation of ~22 million tons in global maize production over the study period. Similar climate variability driven average annual rice, wheat and soybean production variability is ~3, 9 and 2 million tons, respectively. These average fluctuations are similar to the total maize production of many Latin American and African countries or the total rice production of some Asian countries or total wheat production of some Eastern European countries. In some cases the impact of climate variability is higher in poorer regions such as in northeastern Brazil for maize, and Central India for rice. However, even in the most productive global areas such as wheat in Western Europe and maize in the United States Midwest the influence of climate variability on yield variability is very high and in specific political units &gt;75%. The following section discusses our regional and continental findings in the context of previous smaller-scale research, which we use to help validate/corroborate our results and explore possible drivers.</p><p>In the North China Plains (provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Beijing, Tianjin and Shanxi) though crops are irrigated<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Portmann, F. T., Siebert, S. &amp; Döll, P. MIRCA2000 – Global monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000: A new high-resolution data set for agricultural and hydrological modeling. Global Biogeochem. Cycles 24, GB1011 (2010)." id="ref-link-45">22</a></sup>, water availability is a major problem<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Fang, Q. et al. Irrigation strategies to improve the water use efficiency of wheat-maize double cropping systems in North China Plain. Agric. Water Manag. 97, 1165–1174 (2010)." id="ref-link-46">23</a></sup>. Maize is a summer crop in this region and monsoonal rainfall supplements river and groundwater irrigation. High growing season temperature is common. Hence, both the temperature and precipitation variability controls maize yield variability in the North China plains. To the west of the North China Plains, in the more arid Loess Plateau region, adaptation strategies to the arid climate and the coincidence of rainfall during the later stages of crop growth<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Zhang, S., Sadras, V., Chen, X. &amp; Zhang, F. Water use efficiency of dryland maize in the Loess Plateau of China in response to crop management. Field Crops Res. 163, 55–63 (2014)." id="ref-link-47">24</a></sup> lead to normal and extreme temperature variability being a better explanation of maize yield variability in some areas of Gansu and Ningxia and all of Shaanxi. Although it may appear counter-intuitive that temperature variability would dominate for rainfed maize, it is consistent with findings for rainfed maize areas in the United States<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Lobell, D. B. et al. The critical role of extreme heat for maize production in the United States. Nat. Climate Change 3, 497–501 (2013)." id="ref-link-48">25</a></sup> where extreme temperature was found to be a better predictor of maize grain yield due to its control on soil water demand and transpiration rates. In contrast, wheat is a winter crop and is highly dependent on irrigation in the North China Plains. What our analysis shows is more dependence on precipitation variability for wheat yields, which may be due to the direct controlling influence on surface irrigation water availability. In northeastern China (provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liolin) maize and soybean are not widely irrigated so precipitation variability was important, but rice is irrigated so temperature variability became more important.</p><p>In Japan almost all the paddy rice crop is irrigated<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Portmann, F. T., Siebert, S. &amp; Döll, P. MIRCA2000 – Global monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000: A new high-resolution data set for agricultural and hydrological modeling.

Methan and nitrous oxide emissions from a paddy field with Japanese conventional water management and fertilizer application. Global Biogeochem. Cycles 18, GB2017 (2004)." id="ref-link-50">26</a></sup> and hence temperature variability was more important compared with precipitation variability. South Korean harvested rice is similarly mostly irrigated and thus temperature variability was more important for explaining rice yield variability. In Indonesia the variability in rice yield explained by climate variability is often low (in the 0 to 15% range only) and the explanation is on account of temperature variability<sup><a href="#ref27" title="Peng, S. et al. Rice yields decline with higher night temperature from global warming. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 101, 9971–9975 (2004)." id="ref-link-51">27</a></sup> except in some parts such as Central Java where precipitation variability is also important<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Naylor, R. L., Battisti, D. S., Vimont, D. J., Falcon, W. P. &amp; Burke, M. B. Assessing risks of climate variability and climate change for Indonesian rice agriculture. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 104, 7752–7757 (2007)." id="ref-link-52">28</a></sup>. This is because rice is widely irrigated in Indonesia<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Portmann, F. T., Siebert, S. &amp; Döll, P. MIRCA2000 – Global monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000: A new high-resolution data set for agricultural and hydrological modeling. Global Biogeochem.

The blue, green and grey water footprint of rice from production and consumption perspectives. Ecol. Econ. 70, 749–758 (2011)." id="ref-link-54">29</a></sup>.</p><p>In South Asia, especially northwest India, temperature variability influences wheat yield variability widely, similar to other findings<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Lobell, D. B., Sibley, A. &amp; Ortiz-Monasterio, J. I. Extreme heat effects on wheat senescence in India. Nat. Climate Change 2, 186–189 (2012)." id="ref-link-55">30</a></sup> but further south in central and south India precipitation variability in general is more important as between half and three-fourths of wheat is rainfed winter wheat compared with only a few percent in the northwest. Rice yield variability is more influenced by precipitation variability in India indicating the rainfed paddy growing conditions. In the more irrigated parts<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Portmann, F. T., Siebert, S. &amp; Döll, P. MIRCA2000 – Global monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000: A new high-resolution data set for agricultural and hydrological modeling. Global Biogeochem. Cycles 24, GB1011 (2010)." id="ref-link-56">22</a></sup> as in northwest India precipitation and temperature variability or only temperature variability was important. In the extreme southwestern parts of India similarly precipitation and/or temperature variability was important as this region receives very high rainfall. Temperature variability was the important factor for rice yield variability in Bangladesh due to high availability of water and intense irrigation controlling the influence of precipitation variability. In some of the highly irrigated rice areas in India such as areas of West Bengal state, and the Mahanadi system in northern Orissa, climate variability was not even statistically significant (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms6989/full/ncomms6989.html#f2">Figs 2b</a> and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms6989/full/ncomms6989.html#f3">3b</a>).</p><p>In Australia wheat yield variability is largely explained by precipitation variability as the wheat is grown under rainfed conditions<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Portmann, F. T., Siebert, S. &amp; Döll, P. MIRCA2000 – Global monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000: A new high-resolution data set for agricultural and hydrological modeling.

C. The impact of temperature variability on wheat yields. Global Change Biol. 17, 997–1012 (2011)." id="ref-link-60">33</a></sup> especially in parts of Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.</p><p>We found that maize yield variability is explained best by normal and extreme precipitation variability related to ENSO in many countries of Africa similar to previous findings as in Zimbabwe<sup><a href="#ref34" title="Phillips, J. G., Cane, M. A. &amp; Rosenzweig, C. ENSO, seasonal rainfall patterns and simulated maize yield variability in Zimbabwe. Agric. Forest Meteorol. 90, 39–50 (1998)." id="ref-link-61">34</a></sup>, which in turn is related to sea surface temperature<sup><a href="#ref35" title="Cane, M. A., Eshel, G. &amp; Buckland, R. W. Forecasting Zimbabwean maize yield using eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature. Nature 370, 204–205 (1994)." id="ref-link-62">35</a></sup>. In South Africa maize is grown primarily in the Highveld region with drier conditions in the west and wetter conditions in the east<sup><a href="#ref36" title="Walker, N. J. &amp; Schulze, R. E. Climate change impacts on agro-ecosystem sustainability across three climate regions in the maize belt of South Africa. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 124, 114–124 (2008)." id="ref-link-63">36</a></sup>. Our analysis reflects these conditions with precipitation variability being more important in the drier west and temperature variability more important moving towards the wetter eastern provinces of South Africa’s Highveld. Moreover, high maize yield variability in South Africa has been a concern<sup><a href="#ref36" title="Walker, N. J. &amp; Schulze, R. E. Climate change impacts on agro-ecosystem sustainability across three climate regions in the maize belt of South Africa. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 124, 114–124 (2008)." id="ref-link-64">36</a></sup>; indeed, we found that climate variability explained &gt;60% of maize yield variability in the Highveld region especially in the drier western parts of the Highveld of South Africa.</p><p>Elsewhere, as in Kenya, we found that maize yield variability was explained only by a complex relationship between both precipitation and temperature variability consistent with previous studies<sup><a href="#ref37" title="Amissah-Arthur, A. &amp; Jagtap, S. Rosenzweig Spatio-temporal effects of El Nino events on rainfall and maize yield in Kenya. Int. J. Climatol. 22, 1849–1860 (2002)." id="ref-link-65">37</a></sup>. In Cameroon in West Africa and in northeastern Nigeria precipitation variability alone does not explain maize yield variability agreeing with previous findings<sup><a href="#ref38" title="Tingem, M., Rivington, M. &amp; Colls, J.

Climate Res. 30, 53–60 (2005)." id="ref-link-67">39</a></sup> because, while rain is beneficial for stable maize production, it also triggers nitrogen leaching from nutrient poor soils, leading to a negative feedback. In many of the other West African countries rainfall variability explains maize yield variability but analyses show that this was not the case everywhere and neither does climate variability explain maize yield variability in all countries here as farmers adopt various management strategies to overcome the high rainfall variability<sup><a href="#ref40" title="Bayala, J. et al. Cereal yield response to conservation agriculture practices in drylands of West Africa: A quantitative synthesis. J. Arid Environ. 78, 13–25 (2012)." id="ref-link-68">40</a></sup>. However, other than Nigeria, our analysis in West Africa was only at the country level and within-country explanatory skill was lost on account of the scale of the available yield statistics. Overall, precipitation variability is more important in sub-Saharan Africa, pointing to the predominantly rainfed system of maize cultivation<sup><a href="#ref41" title="Coo, J. &amp; Cox, C. Effects of rainfall variability on maize yields. In:Atlas of African Agriculture Research &amp; Development (ed. Kate Sebastian International Food Policy Research Institute (2014) doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.2499/9780896298460." id="ref-link-69">41</a></sup>.</p><p>In most of the Eastern Europe and many regions of Western European countries, the effect of temperature variability in explaining wheat yield variability was more important as also found in previous regional and global studies (refs <a href="#ref42" title="Peltonen-Sainio, P. et al. Coincidence of variation in yield and climate in Europe. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 139, 483–489 (2010)." id="ref-link-70">42</a>, <a href="#ref43" title="Chloupek, O., Hrstkova, P. &amp; Schweigert, P.

This is because of the continental climate of Eastern Europe, which causes a greater amplitude of temperature variability<sup><a href="#ref44" title="Maracchi, G., Sirotenko, O. &amp; Bindi, M. Impacts of present and future climate variability on agriculture and forestry in the temperate regions: Europe. Climatic Change 70, 117–135 (2005)." id="ref-link-72">44</a></sup>. Our study shows that normal, both normal and extreme, and extreme temperature variability was important in explaining wheat yield variability. In Southern Europe and in the Mediterranean regions in addition to heat stress the water limiting conditions that are common<sup><a href="#ref44" title="Maracchi, G., Sirotenko, O. &amp; Bindi, M.

Global Planetary Change 94-95, 33–45 (2012)." id="ref-link-75">46</a></sup> resulted in precipitation variability also being important for wheat yield variability. The influence of climate variability on wheat yield variability was not statistically significant everywhere. Neither was the explained variability in statistically significant areas high everywhere. This was because farmers are already adapted, or adapting, to climate change<sup><a href="#ref47" title="Olesen, J. E. et al. Impacts and adaptation of European crop production systems to climate change. Eur. J. Agronomy 34, 96–112 (2011)." id="ref-link-76">47</a></sup>, which has made them also more adapted to variability. In the United Kingdom either precipitation variability or both temperature and precipitation variability explained ~45% of wheat yield variability; the precipitation variability is in turn related with the North Atlantic Oscillation<sup><a href="#ref48" title="Porter, J. R. &amp; Semenov, M. A. Crop responses to climatic variation. Phil. Transact. Royal Soc. B 360, 2012–2035 (2005)." id="ref-link-77">48</a></sup>.</p><p>Maize is partly irrigated in France, but irrigation does not fully mitigate dry conditions<sup><a href="#ref49" title="van der Velde, M., Wriedt, G. &amp; Bouraoui, F. Estimating irrigation use and effects on maize during the 2003 heatwave in France. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 135, 90–97 (2010)." id="ref-link-78">49</a></sup>; hence precipitation variability is important and also because irrigated maize areas have only recently increased in area and thus historically precipitation variability could not be compensated as effectively as more recently. The net result is that in many maize areas of France historically both temperature and precipitation variability are important<sup><a href="#ref50" title="Hawkins, E. et al.

Global Change Biol. 19, 937–947 (2013)." id="ref-link-79">50</a></sup>.</p><p>In the United States climate variability was important especially in the Midwestern U.S. for maize yields. While in the upper Midwest temperature variability was more important, in the central Midwest precipitation variability was more important. In Nebraska, a U.S. Great Plains state with a prevalence of irrigated maize in its western part, temperature variability was more important than in the eastern parts where precipitation variability was more important. Many of the counties of the Great Plains states with dryland maize meet their crop water demands partly from irrigation<sup><a href="#ref51" title="Nielsen, D. C., Vigil, M. F. &amp; Benjamin, J. G. The variable response of dryland corn yield to soil water content at planting. Agric. Water Manag. 96, 330–336 (2009)." id="ref-link-80">51</a></sup> and we identify large number of counties where both precipitation and temperature variability was important. In other rainfed maize-producing countries normal and extreme temperature conditions explained maize yield variability due to increased soil water demand that raised transpiration rates and vapor pressure deficits<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Lobell, D. B. et al. The critical role of extreme heat for maize production in the United States. Nat. Climate Change 3, 497–501 (2013)." id="ref-link-81">25</a>, <a href="#ref52" title="Lobell, D. B. et al. Greater sensitivity to drought accompanies maize yield increase in the U.S. Midwest. Science 344, 516–519 (2014)." id="ref-link-82">52</a></sup>. Overall only temperature variability explained maize and soybean yield variability in more harvested regions (~37 and 38%, respectively) compared with precipitation only explained regions (~31 and 36%, respectively); climate variability explained part of the yield variability in ~91% of the U.S. maize harvested areas and 82% of soybean harvested areas. Less adaptation of farmers to increasingly warmer temperatures may explain why in larger areas temperature variability was important<sup><a href="#ref53" title="Schlenker, W. &amp; Roberts, M. J.

Precipitation variability was more important overall, but pockets of regions where temperature variability was more important exists such as in Sinaloa where irrigated maize is important, and in Guerrero. Temperature variability explained maize yield variability also in most Central American countries. Further south in Brazil, precipitation variability was more important overall; in specific regions temperature variability is overall more important such as Mato Grosso state due to its wetter climate, although in ~23% of Brazil’s maize harvested areas both temperature and precipitation variabilities were important in explaining part of the maize crop yield variability. In Argentina both temperature and precipitation variabilities were equally important overall, though in specific locations temperature variability was more important presumably due to irrigated maize.</p><p>Although this is the most spatially detailed global assessment of the links between historical climate variability and yield done to date, our study has some limitations. For example, our estimation of crop yield variability due to climate variability may underestimate the importance of climate variability impacts at specific locations within political units. Future studies should investigate this problem at an even finer resolution globally, but this is challenging given historical yield data availability.</p><p>In some countries both crop yield and weather data may have quality issues<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Ray, D. K., Ramankutty, N., Mueller, N. D., West, P. C. &amp; Foley, J. A. Recent patterns of crop yield growth and stagnation. Nat.

Our study is based on yield data at the county/district/municipal/department or larger political unit level, so we used crop harvested area weighted gridded weather data for the political units. However, weather data from individual stations could give a distinct climate-yield response signal due to its very localized scale. To test this latter issue, we carried out a separate analysis using daily station data from ~100 U.S. counties<sup><a href="#ref54" title="National Climate Data Center (NCDC) available from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/." id="ref-link-86">54</a></sup> that contributed to ~25% of total U.S. maize production. We found statistically significant correlation (<i>r</i>=0.54; <i>P</i>=0.001) between analyses conducted by the two different data sets. A stronger relationship is likely not present with station data analysis due to the sheer size of some political units and lack of complete coverage, which is present in gridded data (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms6989/full/ncomms6989.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>). As our yield was measured at the political unit, the use of the harvested area weighted gridded weather data<sup><a href="#ref18" title="Harris, I., Jones, P. D., Osborn, T. J. &amp; Lister, D. H.

In contrast, the use of station data would be appropriate if crop yields were measured at same sites or locally, and the direct use of gridded data then less appropriate without downscaling.</p><p>While climate variability is a significant factor and responsible for 32–39% of global crop yield variability, it is certainly not the only controlling factor<sup><a href="#ref55" title="Brown, M. E. &amp; Funk, C. C. Food security under climate change. Science 319, 580–581 (2008)." id="ref-link-89">55</a></sup>.
