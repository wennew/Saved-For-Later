                     <p id="p-1">Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports huge amounts of heat from low to high latitudes and has a major
                        influence on climate. Climate models have predicted that global warming will cause the AMOC to slow, but concrete evidence
                        of such a slowdown has been scarce. Srokosz and Bryden review a decade of observations of the AMOC that reveal an unexpected
                        amount of variability over time scales from seasonal to decadal, as well as a general weakening over this time.

                     <div id="sec-1" class="subsection">
                        <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                        <p id="p-3">A 2002 report, <em>Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises</em>, highlighted the North Atlantic circulation as possibly subject to abrupt change in a warming climate. Likewise, the 2001
                           Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report suggested that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)
                           could weaken over the 21st century. As this circulation carries heat northward, giving the United Kingdom and northwest Europe
                           a temperate climate, this generated renewed efforts to make observations of the AMOC. In particular, it led to the deployment
                           of an observing system across the Atlantic at 26.5°N in spring 2004, which last year achieved a decade of measurements.
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     <div id="sec-2" class="subsection">
                        <h3>ADVANCES</h3>
                        <p id="p-4">In addition to the baseline decade of 26.5°N observations, there have been other ongoing measurements that capture components
                           of the AMOC, some of which are not continuous or of much shorter duration. Together these observations are leading to a more
                           complete picture of the AMOC. The 26.5°N AMOC observations have produced a number of surprises on time scales from subannual
                           to multiannual. First, the range of AMOC variability found in the first year, 4 to 35 Sv (Sverdrup, a million cubic meters
                           per second, the standard unit for ocean circulation), was larger than the 15 to 23 Sv found previously from five ship-based
                           observations over 50 years. A similarly large range to that at 26.5°N has subsequently been observed at 34.5°S. Second, the
                           amplitude of the seasonal cycle, with a minimum in the spring and a maximum in the autumn, was much larger (~6.7 Sv) than
                           anticipated, and the driving mechanism of wind stress in the eastern Atlantic was unexpected as well. Third, the 30% decline
                           in the AMOC during 2009–2010 was totally unexpected and exceeded the range of interannual variability found in climate models
                           used for the IPCC assessments. This event was also captured by <em>Argo</em> and altimetry observations of the upper limb of the AMOC at 41°N. This dip was accompanied by significant changes in the
                           heat content of the ocean, with potential impacts on weather that are the subject of active research. Finally, over the period
                           of the 26.5°N observations, the AMOC has been declining at a rate of about 0.5 Sv per year, 10 times as fast as predicted
                           by climate models. Whether this is a trend that is a decline due to global warming or part of the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal
                           Oscillation/Variability, inferred from sea surface temperature measurement, is also a subject of active research. There is
                           no doubt that continuously observing the AMOC over a decade has considerably altered our view of the role of ocean variability
                           in climate.

                        <h3>OUTLOOK</h3>
                        <p id="p-5">The 26.5°N AMOC observations are stimulating the development of further AMOC observing systems both to the north, in the North
                           Atlantic subpolar gyre, and to the south, in the South Atlantic. The aim is to obtain a holistic picture of the AMOC from
                           south to north. Given the surprises and insights into the Atlantic circulation that observations have produced to date, it
                           is not too much to expect that with the new observations there will be future “inevitable surprises.
