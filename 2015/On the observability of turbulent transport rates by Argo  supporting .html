Forget, D. Ferreira, and X. Liang<br><br>Although estimation of turbulent transport parameters using inverse
methods is not new, there is little evaluation of the method in the
literature. Here, it is shown that extended observation of the broad
scale hydrography by Argo provides a path to improved estimates of
regional turbulent transport rates. Results from a 20 year
ocean state estimate produced with the ECCO v4 non-linear inverse
modeling framework provide supporting evidence. Turbulent transport
parameter maps are estimated under the constraints of fitting the
extensive collection of Argo profiles collected through 2011. The
adjusted parameters dramatically reduce misfits to in situ profiles
as compared with earlier ECCO solutions. They also yield a clear
reduction in the model drift away from observations over
multi-century long simulations, both for assimilated variables
(temperature and salinity) and independent variables
(bio-geochemical tracers). Despite the minimal constraints imposed
specifically on the estimated parameters, their geography is
physically plausible and exhibits close connections with the upper
ocean ocean stratification as observed by Argo. The estimated
parameter adjustments furthermore have first order impacts on
upper-ocean stratification and mixed layer depths over
20 years. These results identify the constraint of fitting
Argo profiles as an effective observational basis for regional
turbulent transport rates. Uncertainties and further improvements of
the method are discussed.
