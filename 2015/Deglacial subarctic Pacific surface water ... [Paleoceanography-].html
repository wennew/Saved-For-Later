		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The glacial-to-Holocene evolution of subarctic Pacific surface water stratification and silicic acid (Si) dynamics is investigated based on new combined diatom oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>diat</sub>) and silicon (δ<sup>30</sup>Si<sub>diat</sub>) isotope records, along with new biogenic opal, subsurface foraminiferal δ<sup>18</sup>O, alkenone-based sea surface temperature, sea-ice, diatom and core logging data from the NE Pacific. Our results suggest that δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>diat</sub> values are primarily influenced by changes in freshwater discharge from the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS), while corresponding δ<sup>30</sup>Si<sub>diat</sub> are primarily influenced by changes in Si supply to surface waters.</p></div>
<div><p>Our data indicate enhanced glacial to mid-HS1 NE Pacific surface water stratification, generally limiting the Si supply to surface waters. However, we suggest that an increase in Si supply during early HS1, when surface waters were still stratified, is linked to increased North Pacific Intermediate Water formation. The coincidence between fresh surface waters during HS1 and enhanced ice-rafted debris sedimentation in the North Atlantic indicates a close link between CIS and Laurentide Ice Sheet dynamics and a dominant atmospheric control on CIS deglaciation. The Bølling/Allerød (B/A) is characterized by destratification in the subarctic Pacific and an increased supply of saline, Si-rich waters to surface waters. This change towards increased convection occurred prior to the Bølling warming and is likely triggered by a switch to sea-ice-free conditions during late HS1. Our results furthermore indicate a decreased efficiency of the biological pump during late HS1 and the B/A (possibly also the Younger Dryas), suggesting that the subarctic Pacific has then been a source region of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>
