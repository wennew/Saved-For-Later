Notice how the final frame suddenly is whiter than the preceding frame? That's a sign that we have entered the final phase of the melting season, when temperatures drop and melt ponds within the ice pack freeze over again. Sea ice concentration goes up, and the NSIDC SIC map becomes whiter.</p>\n<p>But the Pacific side of the Arctic is still bluish. During the past two weeks the disintegration of that part of the ice pack has continued, spurred on by a late cyclone that further stressed the region (see special <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/arms-race-and-a-storm.html\">blog post</a> on the matter) and increased the area that shows a a mix of ice floes and open water. The compaction potential of this region will probably decide where this melting season will end up on the various sea ice area and extent graphs.</p>\n<p>And this end result still holds interest, because - somewhat surprisingly - the 2015 melting season could still achieve a top 3 minimum. Surprising, because the melting season started out with more volume, more multi-year ice, saw little and late preconditioning during May and June, and - despite a killer July - there has been relatively little transport and compaction this year.</p>\n<p>With melting momentum mostly out of the picture now, it all comes down to compaction.</p>\n<p><span>Sea ice area (SIA)</span></p>\n<p>Here's the latest <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/\">Cryosphere Today</a> SIA chart, to which I've added <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,1112.msg62388.html#msg62388\">preliminary data</a> as calculated by Wipneus:</p>\n<a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086b9166970d-pi\"><img title=\"CTSIA20150831\" alt=\"CTSIA20150831\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086b9166970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a>Given some heavy losses extent-wise in the past week (see below), I had expected CT SIA to follow suit, but nothing really happened after the uptick due to melt pond refreezing, escept for one daily drop of 85K. Nevertheless, the 2015 trend line is still in 6th position and close to other years. Theoretically it could still end up 3rd, but it doesn't look likely. The 2013 and 2014 daily minimums have already been surpassed, with at least one more week of decrease left to go.\n<p><span>Sea ice extent (SIE)</span></p>\n<p>Sea ice extentÂ based on data from the Japanese <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://ads.nipr.ac.jp/vishop/vishop-extent.html?N\">Arctic Data archive System</a> website, paints a different picture:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c742c9970b-pi\"><img title=\"IJISSIE20150831\" alt=\"IJISSIE20150831\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c742c9970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a>Due to some very large drops last week (including two very late century breaks), 2015 is now battling it out with 2007 and 2011. Best of the rest, after the record smashing 2012 melting season, is a distinct possibility. Needless to say, the 2013 and 2014 daily minimums have already been overtaken by a large margin.</p>\n<p><span>Cryosphere Today area per IJIS extent (CAPIE)</span></p>\n<p>With sea ice extent fiercely dropping and sea ice area fiercely stalling, the CAPIE graph is showing something truly spectacular:<a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513217970c-pi\"><img title=\"CAPIE20150831\" alt=\"CAPIE20150831\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513217970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>CAPIE is a compactness measure. It gives an idea of how compact the ice pack is. Melt ponds and dispersed ice floes give the ice pack a less compact appearance. Because these melt ponds and the open water between dispersed floes get counted for sea ice area, but not for sea ice extent (there needs to be less than 15% of ice in a grid, or else the entire grid area gets counted as 100% ice covered), you get an idea of compactness by dividing area numbers with extent numbers.</p>\n<p>CAPIE was really low up until two weeks ago, but things have drastically reversed, a combination of melt pond refreezing, and ice floes on that Pacific side of the ice pack perhaps so far apart that the open water is now getting counted for extent as well. Either way, the 2015 trend line has been shooting through the roof, going from one of the lowest to one of the highest percentages in the 2006-2015 record. Wipneus' <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/_/rsrc/1441086658056/home/amsr2/grf/amsr2-compact-compare.png\">compactness graphs</a> (more consistent and better resolution) show the exact same thing.</p>\n<p><span>Regional SIE and SIA</span></p>\n<p>The same Wipneus has yet again sent me several of his home-made sea ice concentration maps, using the highest resolution AMSR-2 data (3.125 km grid) provided by the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/new-map-on-the-block.html\">University of Hamburg</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's the first, showing how things have changed in the past two weeks on that Pacific side (red = less ice than two weeks ago, blue = more ice than two weeks ago):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d15132fb970c-pi\"><img title=\"Tmp4b\" alt=\"Tmp4b\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d15132fb970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Massive losses in the past fortnight, right where a lot of multi-year was situated. Again, read the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/arms-race-and-a-storm.html\">special blog post</a> that has more details on what has been happening here this year.</p>\n<p>The second image shows the situation in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086b92e7970d-pi\"><img title=\"Tmp4a\" alt=\"Tmp4a\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086b92e7970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Heavy losses there too in the past two weeks, but it seems the Northwest Passage's main route still hasn't entirely cleared, with wisps of sea ice from McClintock Channel still lingering and being pushed out into Viscount Melville Sound. The western entrance is also still more or less blocked by ice in the Beaufort Sea. This animation of satellite images shows how the ice moved in the last three days:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c74466970b-pi\"><img title=\"2015 Aug 29-31\" alt=\"2015 Aug 29-31\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c74466970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>We have to wait and see whether the Northwest Passage will be completely open. Still, a lot of ice has disappeared from the CAA this year (perhaps even more than in 2012), another zone where ice should be oldest and thickest:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c7458f970b-pi\"><img title=\"CAA SIE\" alt=\"CAA SIE\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c7458f970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a>Finally, another Wipneus comparison map, showing the level of compaction (and probably some bottom melting too, as the ice probably isn't very thick there, despite seeing good weather for ice retention all melting season) on the Siberian-Atlantic side of the Arctic in the past two weeks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d151350c970c-pi\"><img title=\"Tmp4c\" alt=\"Tmp4c\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d151350c970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>It remains to be seen how much more compaction can take place here. As commenter and fellow Arctic blogger <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://diablobanquisa.wordpress.com/\">Diablobanquisa</a> points out on the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,1149.msg62443.html#msg62443\">Forum</a>, it seems refreezing at the edges is already taking place.</p>\n<p><span>Weather conditions</span></p>\n<p>And now for the weather...</p>\n<p>This animation of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://ocean.dmi.dk/english/index.php\">Danish Meteorological Institute</a> SLP images shows events in the past two weeks:</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513693970c-pi\"><img title=\"DMISLP2015-7\" alt=\"DMISLP2015-7\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513693970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>The big high pressure area that was announced in the previous <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/asi-2015-update-6-one-more-high.html\">ASI update</a>, came into existence and dominated the Arctic until that cyclone showed up, sliding in via Bering Strait. Both mainly caused dispersal instead of compaction and transport. How low this melting season ends up and when the minimum will be reached, now depends almost entirely on compaction.</p>\n<p>As I wrote back in 2010, at the end of the first melting season that was covered here on the ASIB, in this <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/end-zone-3-sea-level-pressure.html\">blog post</a> dedicated to the influence of atmospheric pressure on the final outcome:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/seaice/processes/circulation.html\">Beaufort Gyre</a>, the clockwise movement of the ice pack from the Pacific side of the Arctic towards the Atlantic side, is dependent on a high over the Beaufort Sea. Combined with a low over the Siberian coast, preferably between the Kara and Laptev Seas, the Transpolar Drift Stream is activated and transports a lot of ice through Fram Strait. The stable positioning of these two poles opposite each other is known as the Arctic Dipole Anomaly.</p>\n<p>This is what you get when that happens:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b0134868d2d93970c-pi\"><img title=\"Cogs\" alt=\"Cogs\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b0134868d2d93970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a>Â </p>\n<p>The sea ice gets compacted towards the coasts of Greenland, Ellesmere Island and the rest of the Canadian Archipelago, and it gets transported towards Fram Strait where it melts out in warmer southern waters. A double whammy, as the American expression goes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's see what the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsecmeur.html\">ECMWF</a> weather forecast model has in store for the coming 6 days (click for a larger version, and go to the ASIG <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts\">Forecasts page</a> for daily forecasts):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba80d970d-pi\"><img title=\"ECMWF2015-7\" alt=\"ECMWF2015-7\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba80d970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>This set-up looks like it could cause a lot of compaction on the Pacific side of the Arctic, especially after a couple of days when strong winds are forecast. However, on the other side, this will also entail transport of the ice pack towards the Atlantic Ocean, causing dispersal. Sea surface temperatures are high over there, but at this point in the melting season I'm not sure how much ice can still be melted. Still, without compaction not much will happen, and this might just be enough to push 2015 really low on extent and area graphs. Don't expect any spectacularly big drops, though.</p>\n<p>On the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php\">DMI 80N temperature graph</a> we're not seeing any spikes or anomalously warm temperatures yet, a sign that the water is releasing its heat so that it can refreeze. On the contrary, it's dipping below the average (not Arctic-wide, but above 80Â°, in the heart of the ice pack):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba90c970d-pi\"><img title=\"MeanT_2015\" alt=\"MeanT_2015\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba90c970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>These freezing temperatures are going to stay confined to the ice pack proper the coming week, as shown on these temperature maps forecast by the GFS model, provided by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cci-reanalyzer.org/\">Climate Reanalyzer</a> (on the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts\">ASIG Forecasts page</a> you can view the anomaly graphs, and see that the Arctic will stay anomalously 'warm'):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086baaaa970d-pi\"><img title=\"Climate Reanalyzer T2-7\" alt=\"Climate Reanalyzer T2-7\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086baaaa970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Of course, it's not just surface air temperatures that are anomalously 'warm', the same goes for sea surface temperatures, as visible on the latest DMI SST anomaly map:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b9e970c-pi\"><img title=\"DMI SSTA 20150901\" alt=\"DMI SSTA 20150901\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b9e970c-350wi\"></a></p>\n<p>Practically all of the ice pack is surrounded by relatively warm waters, which still should make for some bottom melt. Unfortunately I don't have images for 2012 and 2014 at the start of September, but this configuration is clearly running a lot hotter than in 2013:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b86970c-pi\"><img title=\"2013\" height=\"441\" alt=\"2013\" width=\"350\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b86970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>\n<p>As said, the final shape of the ice pack and thus the minimum depend entirely on how much compaction can be conjured by weather conditions. If the winds blow the right way, 2015 could still achieve a draw with previous record years like 2007 and 2011. If they don't, things will probably end up at the 2008 or 2010 level.</p>\n<p>But 100K more or less, 2nd position or 5th position, doesn't matter really all that much when it comes to drawing conclusions about what this melting season constitutes for the bigger picture. The fact is that this melting season will have managed to end up remarkably low given conditions preceding and during the first half of the melting season. A lot of multi-year ice has been melted, the volume rebound has been reversed and both passages are (as good as) open.</p>\n<p>What we learn from this, is that a lack of preconditioning can still be offset by a warm July and a stormy August, although it makes new records nigh impossible, given the high bar 2012 has set. One can imagine what happens when preconditioning is (above) average followed by some freak weather, especially if the Arctic sea ice pack doesn't get the time and space to recover.Â </p>\n<p>Enjoy the Arctic sea ice, it's the only Arctic sea ice you've got.</p></div>","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1441120715000,"title":"ASI 2015 update 7: to compact or not to compact","published":1441118846000,"crawled":1441119293807,"alternate":[{"href":"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/asi-2015-update-7-to-compact-or-not-to-compact.html","type":"text/html"}],"author":"Neven","origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/atom.xml","title":"Arctic Sea Ice","htmlUrl":"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/"},"summary":{"content":"During the melting season I'm writing (bi-)weekly updates on the current situation with regards to Arctic sea ice (ASI).

The compaction potential of this region will probably decide where this melting season will end up on the various sea ice area and extent graphs.</p>&#13;
<p>And this end result still holds interest, because - somewhat surprisingly - the 2015 melting season could still achieve a top 3 minimum. Surprising, because the melting season started out with more volume, more multi-year ice, saw little and late preconditioning during May and June, and - despite a killer July - there has been relatively little transport and compaction this year.</p>&#13;
<p>With melting momentum mostly out of the picture now, it all comes down to compaction.</p>&#13;

<p>Here's the latest <a href="http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/" target="_self">Cryosphere Today</a> SIA chart, to which I've added <a href="http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,1112.msg62388.html#msg62388" target="_self">preliminary data</a> as calculated by Wipneus:</p>&#13;

Nevertheless, the 2015 trend line is still in 6th position and close to other years. Theoretically it could still end up 3rd, but it doesn't look likely. The 2013 and 2014 daily minimums have already been surpassed, with at least one more week of decrease left to go.&#13;
</p><p><span>Sea ice extent (SIE)</span></p>&#13;
<p>Sea ice extentÂ based on data from the Japanese <a href="https://ads.nipr.ac.jp/vishop/vishop-extent.html?N" target="_self">Arctic Data archive System</a> website, paints a different picture:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c742c9970b-pi"><img alt="IJISSIE20150831" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c742c9970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c742c9970b-800wi" title="IJISSIE20150831"/></a>Due to some very large drops last week (including two very late century breaks), 2015 is now battling it out with 2007 and 2011. Best of the rest, after the record smashing 2012 melting season, is a distinct possibility. Needless to say, the 2013 and 2014 daily minimums have already been overtaken by a large margin.</p>&#13;
<p><span>Cryosphere Today area per IJIS extent (CAPIE)</span></p>&#13;
<p>With sea ice extent fiercely dropping and sea ice area fiercely stalling, the CAPIE graph is showing something truly spectacular:<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513217970c-pi"><img alt="CAPIE20150831" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513217970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513217970c-800wi" title="CAPIE20150831"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>CAPIE is a compactness measure. It gives an idea of how compact the ice pack is. Melt ponds and dispersed ice floes give the ice pack a less compact appearance. Because these melt ponds and the open water between dispersed floes get counted for sea ice area, but not for sea ice extent (there needs to be less than 15% of ice in a grid, or else the entire grid area gets counted as 100% ice covered), you get an idea of compactness by dividing area numbers with extent numbers.</p>&#13;
<p>CAPIE was really low up until two weeks ago, but things have drastically reversed, a combination of melt pond refreezing, and ice floes on that Pacific side of the ice pack perhaps so far apart that the open water is now getting counted for extent as well. Either way, the 2015 trend line has been shooting through the roof, going from one of the lowest to one of the highest percentages in the 2006-2015 record. Wipneus' <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/_/rsrc/1441086658056/home/amsr2/grf/amsr2-compact-compare.png" target="_self">compactness graphs</a> (more consistent and better resolution) show the exact same thing.</p>&#13;
<p><span>Regional SIE and SIA</span></p>&#13;
<p>The same Wipneus has yet again sent me several of his home-made sea ice concentration maps, using the highest resolution AMSR-2 data (3.125 km grid) provided by the <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/new-map-on-the-block.html" target="_self">University of Hamburg</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>Here's the first, showing how things have changed in the past two weeks on that Pacific side (red = less ice than two weeks ago, blue = more ice than two weeks ago):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d15132fb970c-pi"><img alt="Tmp4b" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d15132fb970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d15132fb970c-800wi" title="Tmp4b"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Massive losses in the past fortnight, right where a lot of multi-year was situated. Again, read the <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/arms-race-and-a-storm.html" target="_self">special blog post</a> that has more details on what has been happening here this year.</p>&#13;
<p>The second image shows the situation in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086b92e7970d-pi"><img alt="Tmp4a" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086b92e7970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086b92e7970d-800wi" title="Tmp4a"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Heavy losses there too in the past two weeks, but it seems the Northwest Passage's main route still hasn't entirely cleared, with wisps of sea ice from McClintock Channel still lingering and being pushed out into Viscount Melville Sound. The western entrance is also still more or less blocked by ice in the Beaufort Sea. This animation of satellite images shows how the ice moved in the last three days:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c74466970b-pi"><img alt="2015 Aug 29-31" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c74466970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c74466970b-800wi" title="2015 Aug 29-31"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>We have to wait and see whether the Northwest Passage will be completely open. Still, a lot of ice has disappeared from the CAA this year (perhaps even more than in 2012), another zone where ice should be oldest and thickest:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c7458f970b-pi"><img alt="CAA SIE" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c7458f970b img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c7458f970b-800wi" title="CAA SIE"/></a>Finally, another Wipneus comparison map, showing the level of compaction (and probably some bottom melting too, as the ice probably isn't very thick there, despite seeing good weather for ice retention all melting season) on the Siberian-Atlantic side of the Arctic in the past two weeks:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d151350c970c-pi"><img alt="Tmp4c" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d151350c970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d151350c970c-800wi" title="Tmp4c"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>It remains to be seen how much more compaction can take place here. As commenter and fellow Arctic blogger <a href="https://diablobanquisa.wordpress.com/" target="_self">Diablobanquisa</a> points out on the <a href="http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,1149.msg62443.html#msg62443" target="_self">Forum</a>, it seems refreezing at the edges is already taking place.</p>&#13;
<p><span>Weather conditions</span></p>&#13;
<p>And now for the weather...</p>&#13;
<p>This animation of <a href="http://ocean.dmi.dk/english/index.php" target="_self">Danish Meteorological Institute</a> SLP images shows events in the past two weeks:</p>&#13;
<p>Â </p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513693970c-pi"><img alt="DMISLP2015-7" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513693970c img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1513693970c-800wi" title="DMISLP2015-7"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>The big high pressure area that was announced in the previous <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/asi-2015-update-6-one-more-high.html" target="_self">ASI update</a>, came into existence and dominated the Arctic until that cyclone showed up, sliding in via Bering Strait. Both mainly caused dispersal instead of compaction and transport. How low this melting season ends up and when the minimum will be reached, now depends almost entirely on compaction.</p>&#13;
<p>As I wrote back in 2010, at the end of the first melting season that was covered here on the ASIB, in this <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/end-zone-3-sea-level-pressure.html" target="_self">blog post</a> dedicated to the influence of atmospheric pressure on the final outcome:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The <a href="http://nsidc.org/seaice/processes/circulation.html">Beaufort Gyre</a>, the clockwise movement of the ice pack from the Pacific side of the Arctic towards the Atlantic side, is dependent on a high over the Beaufort Sea. Combined with a low over the Siberian coast, preferably between the Kara and Laptev Seas, the Transpolar Drift Stream is activated and transports a lot of ice through Fram Strait. The stable positioning of these two poles opposite each other is known as the Arctic Dipole Anomaly.</p>&#13;
<p>This is what you get when that happens:</p>&#13;
<p><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b0134868d2d93970c-pi"><img alt="Cogs" border="0" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b0134868d2d93970c-800wi" title="Cogs"/></a>Â </p>&#13;
<p>The sea ice gets compacted towards the coasts of Greenland, Ellesmere Island and the rest of the Canadian Archipelago, and it gets transported towards Fram Strait where it melts out in warmer southern waters. A double whammy, as the American expression goes.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Let's see what the <a href="http://www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsecmeur.html" target="_self">ECMWF</a> weather forecast model has in store for the coming 6 days (click for a larger version, and go to the ASIG <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts" target="_self">Forecasts page</a> for daily forecasts):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba80d970d-pi"><img alt="ECMWF2015-7" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba80d970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba80d970d-800wi" title="ECMWF2015-7"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>This set-up looks like it could cause a lot of compaction on the Pacific side of the Arctic, especially after a couple of days when strong winds are forecast. However, on the other side, this will also entail transport of the ice pack towards the Atlantic Ocean, causing dispersal. Sea surface temperatures are high over there, but at this point in the melting season I'm not sure how much ice can still be melted. Still, without compaction not much will happen, and this might just be enough to push 2015 really low on extent and area graphs. Don't expect any spectacularly big drops, though.</p>&#13;
<p>On the <a href="http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php" target="_self">DMI 80N temperature graph</a> we're not seeing any spikes or anomalously warm temperatures yet, a sign that the water is releasing its heat so that it can refreeze. On the contrary, it's dipping below the average (not Arctic-wide, but above 80Â°, in the heart of the ice pack):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba90c970d-pi"><img alt="MeanT_2015" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba90c970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086ba90c970d-800wi" title="MeanT_2015"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>These freezing temperatures are going to stay confined to the ice pack proper the coming week, as shown on these temperature maps forecast by the GFS model, provided by <a href="http://cci-reanalyzer.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Climate Reanalyzer</a> (on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts" target="_self">ASIG Forecasts page</a> you can view the anomaly graphs, and see that the Arctic will stay anomalously 'warm'):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086baaaa970d-pi"><img alt="Climate Reanalyzer T2-7" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086baaaa970d img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb086baaaa970d-800wi" title="Climate Reanalyzer T2-7"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Of course, it's not just surface air temperatures that are anomalously 'warm', the same goes for sea surface temperatures, as visible on the latest DMI SST anomaly map:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b9e970c-pi"><img alt="DMI SSTA 20150901" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b9e970c img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b9e970c-350wi" title="DMI SSTA 20150901"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Practically all of the ice pack is surrounded by relatively warm waters, which still should make for some bottom melt. Unfortunately I don't have images for 2012 and 2014 at the start of September, but this configuration is clearly running a lot hotter than in 2013:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b86970c-pi"><img alt="2013" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b86970c img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d1514b86970c-800wi" title="2013"/></a></p>&#13;
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>&#13;
<p>As said, the final shape of the ice pack and thus the minimum depend entirely on how much compaction can be conjured by weather conditions. If the winds blow the right way, 2015 could still achieve a draw with previous record years like 2007 and 2011. If they don't, things will probably end up at the 2008 or 2010 level.</p>&#13;
<p>But 100K more or less, 2nd position or 5th position, doesn't matter really all that much when it comes to drawing conclusions about what this melting season constitutes for the bigger picture. The fact is that this melting season will have managed to end up remarkably low given conditions preceding and during the first half of the melting season. A lot of multi-year ice has been melted, the volume rebound has been reversed and both passages are (as good as) open.</p>&#13;
<p>What we learn from this, is that a lack of preconditioning can still be offset by a warm July and a stormy August, although it makes new records nigh impossible, given the high bar 2012 has set. One can imagine what happens when preconditioning is (above) average followed by some freak weather, especially if the Arctic sea ice pack doesn't get the time and space to recover.Â </p>&#13;
<p>Enjoy the Arctic sea ice, it's the only Arctic sea ice you've got.</p>
