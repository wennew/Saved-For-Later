Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) in climate change monitoring. In the
past two decades, sea level has been routinely measured from space using
satellite altimetry techniques. In order to address a number of important
scientific questions such as &quot;Is sea level rise accelerating?&quot;, &quot;Can we
close the sea level budget?&quot;, &quot;What are the causes of the regional and
interannual variability?&quot;, &quot;Can we already detect the anthropogenic forcing
signature and separate it from the internal/natural climate variability?&quot;,
and &quot;What are the coastal impacts of sea level rise?&quot;, the accuracy of
altimetry-based sea level records at global and regional scales needs to be
significantly improved. For example, the global mean and regional sea level
trend uncertainty should become better than 0.3 and 0.5 mm year<sup>−1</sup>,
respectively (currently 0.6 and 1–2 mm year<sup>−1</sup>). Similarly, interannual
global mean sea level variations (currently uncertain to 2–3 mm) need to be
monitored with better accuracy. In this paper, we present various data improvements achieved within the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate
Change Initiative (ESA CCI) project on &quot;Sea Level&quot; during its first phase
(2010–2013), using multi-mission satellite altimetry data over the 1993–2010
time span. In a first step, using a new processing system with dedicated
algorithms and adapted data processing strategies, an improved set of sea
level products has been produced. The main improvements include: reduction
of orbit errors and wet/dry atmospheric correction errors, reduction of
instrumental drifts and bias, intercalibration biases, intercalibration
between missions and combination of the different sea level data sets, and
an improvement of the reference mean sea surface. We also present
preliminary independent validations of the SL_cci products,
based on tide gauges comparison and a sea level budget closure approach, as
well as comparisons with ocean reanalyses and climate model outputs.
