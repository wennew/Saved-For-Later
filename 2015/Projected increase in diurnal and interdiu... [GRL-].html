		<h3>Abstract</h3><div><p>Beyond the mean warming, climate change may modify the temperature variability, with consequences on extreme events causing societal and environmental impacts. Here we assess future changes in both the interdiurnal variability (ITV) and diurnal range (DTR) of European summer temperatures based on Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project projections under three 21st century scenarios. Both indices are projected to increase, with a rather good model agreement on the sign, while uncertainties remain on the amplitude. Extremely high day-to-day and diurnal temperature variations are expected to occur more frequently. Across models and scenarios, ITV and DTR increases vary primarily as functions of the decrease in surface evapotranspiration linked to the European summer drying.
