		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The cold tongue mode (CTM) is the second EOF mode of sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) variability over the tropical Pacific, and represents the out–of–phase relationship in SSTA variability between the Pacific cold tongue region and elsewhere in the tropical Pacific. A positive CTM is characterized by cold SSTA in the Pacific cold tongue region and warm SSTA in the rest of the tropical Pacific, with conditions reversed for a negative CTM. The CTM is a coupled air–sea mode, and its long–term variability is most probably induced by ocean dynamical processes in response to global warming [<em>Zhang et al</em>., 2010]. This study focuses on the specific ocean dynamical processes associated with the CTM and its possible relationship with global warming.
