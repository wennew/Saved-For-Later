The study was motivated by the fact that there exist substantial differences in observational SST analyses, and by the possibility that lacking sufficient accuracy for SSTs in dynamical models may degrade the MJO simulation and prediction. Experiments for the DYNAMO Intensive Observing Period were carried out using the NCEP atmospheric Global Forecast System (GFS) with three convection schemes forced by three SST specifications. The SST specifications included the widely used National Climate Data Center (NCDC) daily SST analysis, the TRIMM Microwave Imager (TMI) SST retrieval, and an SST climatology (Clim) that only contains climatological seasonal cycle.</p><p class="last">The experiments show that for all convection schemes, the advantage of using observed (TMI and NCDC) SSTs over the Clim SSTs can be seen as early as 5 days to one week after the start of the forecast. Further, the prediction with TMI SSTs was more skillful than that with the NCDC SSTs, indicating that the current level of SST uncertainties in the observational analyses can lead to large differences when they are used as the lower boundary conditions. The results suggest that the simulation and prediction can be improved with an atmosphere-only model forced by more accurate SSTs, or with a coupled atmosphere-ocean model that has a more realistic representation of the SST variability. Differences in the prediction among the convection schemes are also presented and discussed.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><i>Corresponding author</i><p>: Wanqiu Wang, NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, 5830 University Research Court, Room 3004, College Park, Maryland 20740. ; e-mail: </p><a class="email" href="mailto:wanqiu.wang@noaa.gov">wanqiu.wang@noaa.gov</a></div></div><p class="articleDivider"/></div>
