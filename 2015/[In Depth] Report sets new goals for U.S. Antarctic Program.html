                     <p id="p-2">U.S. research in Antarctica needs fresh initiatives and better equipment, concludes a new report by the National Academies—but
                        how to afford them remains a conundrum. The report, commissioned by the National Science Foundation, is the third major assessment
                        of its U.S. Antarctic Program in 3 years, aiming to streamline research and improve logistical efficiency in an era of tight
                        budgets and rising infrastructure costs. The new study lays out a strategic vision for research on the continent over the
                        next decade: It calls for continuing a core program of scientist-driven research, but also for the creation of three priority
                        research initiatives: focusing on the continent's changing ice sheets and their potential impact on rising sea levels; Antarctica's
                        changing ecosystems and the genomics of cold-adapted species; and a next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background Program to
                        probe deeper into the origins of the universe.
