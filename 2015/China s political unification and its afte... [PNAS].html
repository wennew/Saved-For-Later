                           <p id="p-3">During the Bronze Age, the diverse cultural traditions of the earlier Chinese Neolithic were interconnected into more expansive
                              political and economic networks that culminated in the establishment of the region’s first empires (Qin and Han). Drawing
                              on documents and archaeology, we outline the processes associated with this political consolidation and steps that were taken
                              during imperial governance at both the national and a specific local scale (coastal Shandong Province), where we have conducted
                              two decades of archaeological settlement pattern research. Through the juxtaposition of macro- and microscale analysis, we
                              document human impacts of infrastructural investments, interactive technologies, and ideological tenets that were implemented
                              during the Qin–Han dynasties, which helped establish the rough spatial configuration of what has since been China.

                           <h2>Abstract</h2>
                           <p id="p-4">The Neolithic (ca. 8000–1900 B.C.) underpinnings of early Chinese civilization had diverse geographic and cultural foundations
                              in distinct traditions, ways of life, subsistence regimes, and modes of leadership. The subsequent Bronze Age (ca. 1900–221
                              B.C.) was characterized by increasing political consolidation, expansion, and heightened interaction, culminating in an era
                              of a smaller number of warring states. During the third century B.C., the Qin Dynasty first politically unified this fractious
                              landscape, across an area that covers much of what is now China, and rapidly instituted a series of infrastructural investments
                              and other unifying measures, many of which were maintained and amplified during the subsequent Han Dynasty. Here, we examine
                              this historical sequence at both the national and macroscale and more deeply for a small region on the coast of the Shandong
                              Province, where we have conducted several decades of archaeological research. At both scales, we examine apparent shifts in
                              the governance of local diversity and some of the implications both during Qin–Han times and for the longer durée.
