		<b>Sunda Shelf Seas: flushing rates and residence times</b><br><br>Ocean Science Discussions, 12, 863-895, 2015<br><br>Author(s): B. Mayer, T. Stacke, I. Stottmeister, and T. Pohlmann<br><br>The region of the Sunda Shelf has an average depth of
approx. 48 m and is subject to many physical and
biogeochemical processes with a strong impact from human
activities. For the investigation of marine environmental water
properties and quality, it is helpful to have an idea about exchange
rates of water masses in the different parts of this region. Four
numerical models, the global hydrodynamical model MPI-OM, the global
hydrological model MPI-HM, the regional hydrodynamical model HAMSOM
and a Lagrangian tracer model have been utilized to estimate the
flushing rates and residence times in different seas on the Sunda
Shelf. Using decadal averaged monthly transports, the commonly used
flushing rate formula gives rates for the different months of
approximately 40 to 70 days for the entire Sunda Shelf. For
most parts of it (Malacca Strait, southern South China Sea, Java Sea),
the results are similar, while for the Gulf of Thailand, the flushing
rates amount to 80 to 170 days. The tracer model provides
quite different but very detailed 3-D pictures with residence times of
below 30 days to more than two years, depending on the
location within the region, on the starting layer and on the season.
