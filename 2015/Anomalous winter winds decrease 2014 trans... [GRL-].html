		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Wind-driven transport from the North Pacific in winter provides nutrients to a highly productive region in the transition zone between the subarctic and subtropics. This region supports many species of fish, marine mammals, and seabirds. In winter 2013/2014, anomalous winds from the south weakened nutrient transport in the eastern North Pacific, resulting in substantial decreases in phytoplankton biomass. By January 2014, waters were warmer than usual by 3.5°C at the center of an affected area covering ~1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>. South of this area, winter chlorophyll levels dropped to the lowest levels seen since the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor satellite began taking measurements in 1997. It is anticipated that impacts will be felt in some fisheries and among migrating predators this coming year.</p></div>
