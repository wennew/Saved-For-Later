It's not as huge as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012, but it's pretty decent as far as cyclones go, and it's doing its thing in that part of the Arctic where the ice pack looks weakest, but was strongest at the start of the melting season.The timing of this event is perfect for discussing one of the most important aspects of this melting season.</p>\n<p>The image on the top right shows the ice age distribution at the start of the melting season, red being the oldest multi-year ice at that time. Due to a very intense high pressure area over the Beaufort Sea at the end of the freezing season, heavy winds drove the ice pack apart there (a so-called cracking event), causing this multi-year ice to become interspersed with very thin ice. That's the dark blue spots between all the red.</p>\n<p>During the very <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/melt-pond-may-2015.html\">first phase</a> of the melting season the Beaufort Sea region witnessed a heat wave causing a lot of this thin ice to melt out. Because the ice pack wasn't pushed back together again, many of the multi-year ice floes were surrounded by warming waters, and ever larger holes within the ice pack on the Pacific side of the Arctic started to form. The animation below shows what happened between week 27 and week 32, or June 29th to August 9th:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0869a292970d-pi\"><img title=\"Ice age 2015 27-32\" alt=\"Ice age 2015 27-32\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0869a292970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Just towards the end of the animation the holes are showing up. Unfortunately these maps aren't updated until the minimum has hit, but we can still get an idea of what happened after August 9th by checking out the sea ice concentration maps provided by the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.iup.uni-bremen.de:8084/amsr2/\">University of Bremen</a>.

This arm of older, thicker ice was kind of holding on, but is now definitely being finished off by the storm mentioned in the introduction.</p>\n<p>So, how about that storm?

<p>The image on the top right shows the ice age distribution at the start of the melting season, red being the oldest multi-year ice at that time.

<p>So, how about that storm? After coming from the Pacific through Bering Strait it arrived in the Beaufort Sea yesterday where it is staying put now at 985 hPa, after having bottomed out at 983 hPa (according to <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/analysis/index_e.html" target="_self">Environment Canada</a>):</p>&#13;

Westerly winds were gusting up to 50 miles an hour, pushing waves up to the top of the beach and causing some erosion, the National Weather Service said.</p>&#13;
<p>A National Weather Service employee in Barrow captured still images and video of the high waves and flooding.</p>&#13;
<p>The service has issued a <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=AKZ202&amp;warncounty=AKC185&amp;firewxzone=AKZ202&amp;local_place1=%20&amp;product1=Coastal+Flood+Warning&amp;lat=70.6873&amp;lon=-155.371#.Vd-NOvlViko" target="_blank">coastal flood warning</a> for Barrow until Friday morning, along with a <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=AKZ201&amp;warncounty=AKC185&amp;firewxzone=AKZ201&amp;local_place1=39%20Miles%20SSW%20Wainwright%20Airport%20AK&amp;product1=High+Surf+Advisory&amp;lat=70.0813&amp;lon=-160.332#.Vd-ONflViko" target="_blank">high surf advisory</a> for the western part of the North Slope and a <a href="http://marine.weather.gov/MapClick.php?zoneid=PKZ235&amp;mp=0#.Vd9wpvlViko" target="_blank">gale warning</a> for much of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Seas up to 14 feet were forecast for Thursday in the Chukchi.</p>&#13;
<p>The big surf and flooding, which has covered a road that runs between the ocean and Barrow’s lagoon, is “not terribly unusual” at this time of the year, said Ryan Metzger, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Fairbanks. Fall is a stormy season, and the timing -- right around the annual minimum sea ice extent -- allows the surf to build and reach shore, he said.</p>&#13;
<p>(...)</p>&#13;
<p>Out in the Chukchi Sea, the strong wind and waves caused Shell to pause oil drilling efforts because of weather for the first time this summer, said Megan Baldino, a company spokeswoman.</p>&#13;
<p>(...)</p>&#13;
<p>More flooding and erosion is expected in the future as fall sea ice dwindles.</p>&#13;

<p>The damage this storm is doing to the ice pack can clearly be seen on the following animation of UB SIC maps, where the flash melting during the past 2 days on the Pacific side of the Arctic is apparent (aside from the arm getting thinner):</p>&#13;

<p>The effects of the storm and its prelude are also being felt on the JAXA sea ice extent chart, where two very late century breaks - which is unprecedented since 2007, even during record years - have caused the trend line to drop into third position, just 17K above 2007:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14f5e10970c-pi"><img alt="IJISSIE20150827" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14f5e10970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14f5e10970c-800wi" title="IJISSIE20150827"/></a>The trend line on the Cryosphere Today sea ice area graph flatlined in the past week due to melt ponds freezing over, but I expect some very heavy drops there as well in the coming week.</p>&#13;
<p>The ECMWF forecast shows the storm will rage for at least a day more - ripping into the ice pack with strong winds, pushing ice floes into the warmer water it's bringing up - and then taper off again (click for a larger version):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c5784c970b-pi"><img alt="ECMWF2015-6b" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c5784c970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c5784c970b-800wi" title="ECMWF2015-6b"/></a></p>&#13;

<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>&#13;
<p>In the <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/20142015-winter-analysis.html" target="_self">Winter Analysis</a> I posted back in May I speculated about whether this broad zone of older, thicker ice would protect the ice pack on the Pacific side of the Arctic, like happened in 2010 and 2011. The answer is: it didn't, it got obliterated. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas proved to be yet again the multi-year ice graveyard instead of the transit they used to be when older ice would make a round-trip around the Arctic and end up even older and thicker against the shores of Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.</p>&#13;
<p>We have to wait and see what the repercussions of all this will be for sea ice volume, ice age distribution and coming melting seasons, but it's clear that Arctic sea ice isn't in any way recovering.</p>
