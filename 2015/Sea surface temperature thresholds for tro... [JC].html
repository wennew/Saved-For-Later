This threshold was widely accepted without further testing, until a recent study suggested a threshold of 25.5° C. That study is revisited here by re-examining the SST for all global TC formations from 1981—2008 using: (i) a broader range of SST threshold values, (ii) an improved method for identifying subtropical storms—any storm that forms poleward of the subtropical jet (STJ), and (iii) a range of TC formation gestation periods, which refers to a time interval prior to formation in which the SST threshold is exceeded for at least one six hour period. Consequently, thresholds reported in this paper are expressed as a combination of SST and gestation period.</p><p class="last">Using the STJ position to identify and exclude subtropical storms, the threshold of 25.5° C SST/48 hour gestation period was found to be robust, but conservative. An examination of TCs of questionable validity (e.g., weak, short-lived and/or storms that formed with baroclinic influences) revealed a further 26 storms (1.2 %) that could arguably be excluded from the analysis. With these storms removed several SST/gestation period threshold combinations were found to be valid including: 25.5° C /18 hours and 26.5° C/36 hours. A practical threshold of 26.5° C/24 hours is proposed as only two additional storms failed to meet this threshold, which supports the often-quoted 26.5° C SST necessary condition for TC formation.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><sup>1</sup> <i>Corresponding Author address:</i><p> Dr. Kevin J.
