But first I want to look at the melt pond distribution maps that were sent to me by David Schröder from the University of Reading and are based on his research published <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/more-on-melt-ponds.html\">last year</a>. A model,  using NCEP reanalysis data for atmospheric forcing, simulates the melt pond distribution across the Arctic, and although pond area in May is only around 1% of the total melting season area, this melt pond cover fraction according to Schröder <em>et al</em> seems to have the strongest impact on the sea-ice state in September.</p>\n<p>This correlation has been contested in a recent study by Jiping Liu <em>et al</em>, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/10/5/054017\">published</a> in Environmental Research Letters back in May.

Although the air temperature was generally higher in June 2015 than in 2014, the melt-pond area in May and June is very similar to 2014 and below the 1979 to 2015 trend line. This is mainly due to a lower fraction of thin-ice in our model simulation in comparison to previous years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, if I've understood correctly, the difference in melt pond cover fraction is compensated by the fact that the ice is thicker on average than last year. That makes sense, as 2015 is still behind last year when it comes to total volume, as calculated by the PIOMAS model (see <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/07/piomas-july-2015.html\">latest update</a>).</p>\n<p>Let's have a look at what temperature anomaly and average sea level pressure have been doing during June. Again, I've divided the month up into two halves, and here's the first map for June 1st to 15th:  <a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb08537a7f970d-pi\"><img title=\"SAT-SLP comparison June 1-15\" alt=\"SAT-SLP comparison June 1-15\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb08537a7f970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>It's clear that the first half of June this year was warmer than in 2013 and 2014, and the SLP map shows a beautiful Dipole configuration with the Arctic perfectly divided along the prime meridian, with low pressure on the Siberian and high pressure on the American side of the Arctic, leading to the only period so far this melting season of serious sea ice transport through Fram Strait. It's also clear that 2015 doesn't come close to the relative warmth of 2007, 2011 and 2012, the years with the lowest September minimums on records.</p>\n<p>Here's the comparison map for June 16th-30th:  <a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb08537b14970d-pi\"><img title=\"SAT-SLP comparison June 16-30\" alt=\"SAT-SLP comparison June 16-30\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb08537b14970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Practically all the maps look cooler in general, compared to the first half of June. 2015 has all of the heat concentrating on the Pacific side of the Arctic, where most of the action has been so far this melting season. Lots of cold around Hudson Bay, where the ice still hasn't melted out. Again, if you look at years like 2007 and 2012, there is much more heat on the periphery. 2015 doesn't do better than 2013.</p>\n<p>Over all, weather conditions during June echo the model results, leading us to conclude that not much melting momentum has been built up during these crucial first two months of the melting season. It resembles the past two rebound years, meaning there is virtually no chance that new records will be set in September. The main question now is: will 2015 be another rebound year or will it end up lower than 2013 and 2014?</p>\n<p>Of course, there isn't a clear cut-off date for melt pond formation and its inertia-like effect on the ice pack. Subsequent weather conditions still play an important role. This melting season, for instance, has run quite a bit warmer than 2013 and 2014 so far, and although the effects of this have taken a while to show up, they are doing so now with a vengeance on our third piece of evidence: compactness maps.</p>\n<p>As I wrote <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/melt-pond-may-2015.html\">last month</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Compactness is calculated by dividing sea ice area numbers with sea ice extent numbers, which gives us a percentage. Short explanation: the Arctic is divided into grid cells. When 15% or more of a grid cell is covered with sea ice it will be counted as 100% covered with ice for extent (meaning the total km2 of the grid cell will be counted for total sea ice extent), whereas the exact amount of km2 that is covered with sea ice will be counted for area. This means that area will always be lower than extent, because of leads or open water within the grid cell.</p>\n<p>Here's the thing: melt ponds fool the satellite sensors into thinking that there is open water where there is none. This will get counted for area, but not for extent (unless a melt pond is so big that the 15% threshold is passed). So, if there are a lot of melt ponds, area will go down faster than extent, and the percentage will drop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's the latest CAPIE graph (Cryosphere Today sea ice area per IJIS sea ice extent) I use for the bi-weekly ASI udpates:<a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d138d849970c-pi\"><img title=\"CAPIE20150715-big\" alt=\"CAPIE20150715-big\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d138d849970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>From being highest at the start of June, the 2015 trend line has dropped quite a bit to the middle of the pack, and now halfway July it is one of the lowest on record. In fact, the compactness graph below, made and updated by commenter <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home\">Wipneus</a>, that uses SIE and SIA data with higher resolution (smaller grid cells) from the same data providers, shows 2015 dropping to record low levels:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7af6730970b-pi\"><img title=\"Amsr2-compact-compare\" alt=\"Amsr2-compact-compare\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7af6730970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a>This is partly caused by large-scale divergence on the Pacific side of the Arctic, as the multi-year ice there is interspersed with first year ice that is melting out, and there isn't much of a compacting wind blowing.
