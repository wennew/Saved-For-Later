		<b>Eddy surface properties and propagation at Southern Hemisphere western boundary current systems</b><br><br>Ocean Science, 11, 629-641, 2015<br><br>Author(s): G. S. Pilo, M. M. Mata, and J. L. L. Azevedo<br><br>Oceanic eddies exist throughout the world oceans, but are more energetic when
associated with western boundary currents (WBC) systems. In these regions,
eddies play an important role in mixing and energy exchange. Therefore, it is
important to quantify and qualify eddies associated with these systems. This
is particularly true for the Southern Hemisphere WBC system where only few
eddy censuses have been performed to date. In these systems, important
aspects of the local eddy population are still unknown, like their spatial
distribution and propagation patterns. Moreover, the understanding of these
patterns helps to establish monitoring programs and to gain insight in how
eddies would affect local mixing. Here, we use a global eddy data set to
qualify eddies based on their surface characteristics in the Agulhas Current
(AC), the Brazil Current (BC) and the East Australian Current (EAC) systems.
The analyses reveal that eddy propagation within each system is highly forced
by the local mean flow and bathymetry. Large values of eddy amplitude and
temporal variability are associated with the BC and EAC retroflections, while
small values occur in the centre of the Argentine Basin and in the Tasman
Sea. In the AC system, eddy polarity dictates the propagation distance. BC
system eddies do not propagate beyond the Argentine Basin, and are advected
by the local ocean circulation. EAC system eddies from both polarities cross
south of Tasmania but only the anticyclonic ones reach the Great Australian
Bight. For all three WBC systems, both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies
present a geographical segregation according to radius size and amplitude.
Regions of high eddy kinetic energy are associated with the eddies' mean
amplitudes, and not with their densities.
