Assuming that past years’ daily rates of change indicate the range of ice loss that can be expected this year, this method gives an envelope of possible minimum extents for the September seasonal minimum. However, it is possible to have unprecedented loss rates, either slow or fast.</p>\n<p>Starting with the ice extent observed on August 31 and then applying 2006 loss rates, the slowest rate in recent years, results in the highest extrapolated minimum for 2015 of 4.50 million square kilometers (1.74 million square miles), and a September monthly average extent of 4.59 million square kilometers (1.77 million square miles). The lowest daily minimum comes from using the 2010 pace, yielding an estimated 4.12 million square kilometers (1.67 million square miles) for the daily minimum, and a September monthly average extent of 4.33 million square kilometers (1.67 million square miles).</p>\n<p>Using an average rate of ice loss from the most recent ten years gives a one-day minimum extent of 4.38 ± 0.11 million square kilometers (1.79 million square miles), and a September monthly average of 4.49 ± 0.09. As of August 31, the 5-day running daily average extent is 4.72 million square kilometers. If no further retreat occurred, 2015 would already be the sixth lowest daily ice extent in the satellite record.</p>\n<p>The forecast places the upcoming daily sea ice minimum between third and fourth lowest, with fourth more likely. There is still a possibility that 2015 extent will be lower than 4.3 million square kilometers, the third lowest sea ice extent, surpassing the 2011 sea ice extent minimum, and a small chance of surpassing 2007, resulting in the second-lowest daily minimum. This assumes that we continue to have sea ice loss rates at least as fast as those of 2010. This was indeed the case for the final ten days of August 2015.</p>\n<h2>Northwest Passage icy; Northern Sea Route remains open</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a rel=\"lightbox[6304]\" href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2015/09/ANIM-CMMBCTCA.gif\"><img height=\"270\" alt=\"Figure 5.

The passage was discovered during 1903 to 1906 by Roald Amundsen, who made the first transit of the passage from Baffin Bay to the Beaufort Sea. This route passes south of Prince of Wales Island and Victoria Island before entering the Beaufort Sea south of Banks Island. Data from the <a href=\"http://suzaku.eorc.jaxa.jp/GCOM_W/w_amsr2/whats_amsr2.html\">AMSR-2 satellite</a>, which uses passive microwave emission, suggests that this path is ice-free. The higher-resolution <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/data/masie/\">Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent (MASIE)</a> product, based on several data sources and human interpretation, shows only a few areas of low-concentration ice. The broader and deeper passage through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, between Lancaster Sound, Parry Channel, and McClure Strait, is still obstructed by ice, but at the end of August ice blocked only a short portion near Victoria Island. Before drawing conclusions about navigability, however, it is important to check with the operational services such as the <a href=\"http://www.natice.noaa.gov\">National Ice Center (NIC)</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.ec.gc.ca/glaces-ice\">Canadian Ice Service (CIS)</a>. The Northern Sea Route, north of the European Russian and Siberian coasts, has remained largely clear of ice for the entire month.</p>\n<h2>Warm surface water near Alaska and the Kara Sea</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a rel=\"lightbox[6304]\" href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2015/09/Figure61.png\"><img height=\"466\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" class=\"wp-image-6327\" src=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2015/09/Figure61-350x466.png\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 6.

However, the winds shifted in later spring, forcing the warmed water layer against the North American mainland rather than dispersing it further into the Arctic Ocean.

This area is likely to melt out by the September ice minimum; however, maximum SSTs in this region will probably not be especially high (currently about 2.5 degrees Celsius, or 5 degrees Fahrenheit above the freezing point of seawater) owing to how late we are in the melt season.</p>\n<h2>NASA airborne mission flies over sea ice in 2015 to support ICESat-2</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-caption\"><a rel=\"lightbox[6304]\" href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2015/09/Figure7.png\"><img height=\"239\" alt=\"images from air campaign\" width=\"350\" class=\"wp-image-6323\" src=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2015/09/Figure7-350x239.png\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 7.

Instrumentation for the three-week campaign (July 28 to August 19) included a laser altimeter called SIMPL and an imaging spectrometer called AVIRIS-NG. ICESat-2 is a satellite-borne laser altimetry mission that uses a new approach to space-borne determination of surface elevation, based on a high measurement rate (10,000 times per second), multiple ground tracks of laser data, and closely spaced orbital tracks to provide more detailed mapping.

<p>Average sea ice extent for August 2015 was 5.61 million square kilometers (2.16 million square miles), the fourth lowest August extent in the satellite record. This is 1.61 million square kilometers (621,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average for the month, and 900,000 square kilometers (350,000 square miles) above the record low for August, set in 2012.</p>

<p>Starting with the ice extent observed on August 31 and then applying 2006 loss rates, the slowest rate in recent years, results in the highest extrapolated minimum for 2015 of 4.50 million square kilometers (1.74 million square miles), and a September monthly average extent of 4.59 million square kilometers (1.77 million square miles). The lowest daily minimum comes from using the 2010 pace, yielding an estimated 4.12 million square kilometers (1.67 million square miles) for the daily minimum, and a September monthly average extent of 4.33 million square kilometers (1.67 million square miles).</p>
<p>Using an average rate of ice loss from the most recent ten years gives a one-day minimum extent of 4.38 ± 0.11 million square kilometers (1.79 million square miles), and a September monthly average of 4.49 ± 0.09. As of August 31, the 5-day running daily average extent is 4.72 million square kilometers. If no further retreat occurred, 2015 would already be the sixth lowest daily ice extent in the satellite record.</p>
<p>The forecast places the upcoming daily sea ice minimum between third and fourth lowest, with fourth more likely. There is still a possibility that 2015 extent will be lower than 4.3 million square kilometers, the third lowest sea ice extent, surpassing the 2011 sea ice extent minimum, and a small chance of surpassing 2007, resulting in the second-lowest daily minimum. This assumes that we continue to have sea ice loss rates at least as fast as those of 2010. This was indeed the case for the final ten days of August 2015.</p>
<h2>Northwest Passage icy; Northern Sea Route remains open</h2>

<p>The southerly route through the Northwest Passage is open. The passage was discovered during 1903 to 1906 by Roald Amundsen, who made the first transit of the passage from Baffin Bay to the Beaufort Sea. This route passes south of Prince of Wales Island and Victoria Island before entering the Beaufort Sea south of Banks Island. Data from the <a href="http://suzaku.eorc.jaxa.jp/GCOM_W/w_amsr2/whats_amsr2.html">AMSR-2 satellite</a>, which uses passive microwave emission, suggests that this path is ice-free. The higher-resolution <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/masie/">Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent (MASIE)</a> product, based on several data sources and human interpretation, shows only a few areas of low-concentration ice. The broader and deeper passage through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, between Lancaster Sound, Parry Channel, and McClure Strait, is still obstructed by ice, but at the end of August ice blocked only a short portion near Victoria Island. Before drawing conclusions about navigability, however, it is important to check with the operational services such as the <a href="http://www.natice.noaa.gov">National Ice Center (NIC)</a> or the <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/glaces-ice">Canadian Ice Service (CIS)</a>. The Northern Sea Route, north of the European Russian and Siberian coasts, has remained largely clear of ice for the entire month.</p>
<h2>Warm surface water near Alaska and the Kara Sea</h2>

The map shows average ocean sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration for August 30, 2015. SST is measured by satellites using thermal emission sensors (a global product, adjusted by comparison with ship and buoy data). Sea ice concentration is derived from NSIDC’s sea ice concentration near-real-time product. Also shown are drifting buoy temperatures at 2.5 meters depth in the ocean (about 8 feet deep: colored circles); gray circles indicates that temperature data from the buoys is not available. <br><br>Credit: M.

<p>Strong winds from the east in spring of this year opened the ice pack in the eastern Beaufort Sea quite early, allowing early warming of the ocean surface. However, the winds shifted in later spring, forcing the warmed water layer against the North American mainland rather than dispersing it further into the Arctic Ocean. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were high as of late August 2015 in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Laptev Seas, as well as in Baffin Bay and the Kara and northern Barents seas.</p>
<p>The remaining area of low concentration ice in the Beaufort Sea has large pockets of warming open water. This area is likely to melt out by the September ice minimum; however, maximum SSTs in this region will probably not be especially high (currently about 2.5 degrees Celsius, or 5 degrees Fahrenheit above the freezing point of seawater) owing to how late we are in the melt season.</p>
<h2>NASA airborne mission flies over sea ice in 2015 to support ICESat-2</h2>

<p>In support of the upcoming Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, NASA recently deployed two instrumented aircraft to Thule Air Force Base, Greenland (near Qaanaaq) to collect data for the development of software to process the satellite data. Instrumentation for the three-week campaign (July 28 to August 19) included a laser altimeter called SIMPL and an imaging spectrometer called AVIRIS-NG. ICESat-2 is a satellite-borne laser altimetry mission that uses a new approach to space-borne determination of surface elevation, based on a high measurement rate (10,000 times per second), multiple ground tracks of laser data, and closely spaced orbital tracks to provide more detailed mapping. Specific science goals of the airborne campaign include assessing how melting ice surfaces and snow-grain-size variability affect the surface return of green-wavelength light (the color of the ICESat-2 lasers).</p>
<p>Over sea ice, the aircraft data provide important information on sea ice freeboard (height of flotation) and snow cover on sea ice. Both are important parameters for correcting satellite measurements of sea ice thickness. Of the more than thirty-five science flight hours of data collected based out of Thule, four flights targeted sea ice in the vicinity of Nares Strait, where loose pack ice, covered in surface melt ponds, was found. These data will be available on the <a href="http://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat2/">NASA ICESat-2 Web site</a> later in the year.</p>
