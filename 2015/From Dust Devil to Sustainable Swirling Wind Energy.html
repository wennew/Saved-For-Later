					<h2>Physical modeling</h2><p>In this part, we discuss the parameters of the physical model (<a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Figure 2</a>, for example) and the initial boundary conditions of the cases outlined in the paper.</p><p>The heating temperature differences and vane incident angle are key parameters for generating the swirling buoyant jet. Nine cases under different temperature (40 K, 60 K, and 80 K) and different angle (0°, 30°, and 60°) were simulated, respectively. The radius of the solar-energy-collecting shed used for the simulation were: 2 m, 20 m, and 200 m, see <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Table 1</a>.</p><h2>Governing equations</h2><p>In our simulations, the <i>k-ε</i> two-equation model was adopted. For computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications, the governing equations were solved in terms of the prescribed boundary and initial conditions. All the variants (velocities, temperature, turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation) to be solved by the governing equations are denoted by <i>φ</i>. The general transport equation for <i>φ</i> is shown in Equation (4),</p><p>

</p><p>Where, <i>ρ</i> is the density of the fluid, <b>U</b> = (<b><i>u, v, w</i></b>) is the velocity vector, <i>Γ<sub><i>φ</i></sub></i> is the generalized diffusion coefficient, and <i>S<sub>φ</sub></i> is the source term. With properly prescribed <i>Γ<sub><i>φ</i></sub></i>, <i>S<sub>φ</sub></i> and <i>φ</i>, the equation can express the continuity, momentum, energy and other scalar equations<sup><a href="#ref19" title="Gu, Z. et al. Primitive environment control for preservation of pit relics in archeology museums of China. Environ. Sci. Technol. 47, 1504–1509 (2013)." id="ref-link-23">19</a></sup>.</p><h2>Algorithm, boundary and initial conditions</h2><p>For the computational domain, the rectangular grid subdivision (grid number) is about 327,430 in total with particularly refinement about the shed area. The PIMPLE (PISO + SIMPLE) algorithm was used to decompose pressure-velocity couple. In terms of the numerical scheme, the time discretization was performed through the first-order bounded implicit method, and the gradient and diffusion terms used were based on the second-order unbounded Gauss interpolation method.</p><p>The boundary and initial conditions are given in <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Table 1</a>. The temperature of the ambient environment was 273 K, and the pressure at the boundary was a standard atmospheric pressure. The open-source CFD code OpenFOAM (Field Operation and Manipulation) was implemented in the simulations.</p><h2>Detailed simulation analysis</h2><p>All the simulation results are shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Table 2</a>. The values in the table are the maximum velocities of the buoyant jet field, including the maximum tangential (swirling) velocity <i>U<sub>τ</sub></i> and the maximum resultant velocity <i>U<sub>mag</sub></i> which were used to study the relationship between velocity and <i>α or ΔT.</i> According to the results of the cases (<i>R</i> = 200 m and <i>α</i> = 0°), the swirling buoyant jet velocity changes with the temperature difference. The simulations with temperature differences of 40 K, 60 K, and 80 K show that the maximum swirling velocity and maximum resultant velocity increased simultaneously with the temperature difference. The maximum swirling velocity showed a 17% incremental increase with a temperature difference increasing from 40 K to 60 K. However, a 10% incremental increase was achieved with a temperature difference increasing from 60 K to 80 K, while the incremental increase in maximum resultant velocity remained at 17%. On the other hand, at the same temperature difference of 80 K, cases of the swirling buoyant jet with the incident angle 0°, 30°, and 60° were also simulated. Larger incident angle would mean less vorticity of the air inflow at the inlet of the shed. Therefore with smaller incident angle, an increase in the maximum swirling velocity was achieved but with a reduction in the maximum resultant velocity. When the incident angle was reduced from 60° to 30°, an incremental increase in the maximum swirling velocity was 39%. However, when the incident angle was reduced from 30° to 0°, an incremental increase of 4% was achieved, with a 14% to 2% reduction in the maximum resultant velocity.</p><p><a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Figure 3</a> shows (a) the contours of the swirling velocity of the buoyant jet and (b) the contours of a dust devil in nature<sup><a href="#ref20" title="Zhao, Y. et al. Mechanism and large eddy simulation of dust devils. Atmosphere-Ocean 42, 61–84 (2004)." id="ref-link-24">20</a></sup> and also (c) low pressure regions at the center of the jet. These features are similar to the dust devils in nature.</p><h2>Experimental investigation</h2><p>According to the physical model (<i>R</i> = 2 m), the mock-up of the shed was constructed to validate the result of numerical simulation (<a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Figure 1a</a>).</p><p>The distance between the end of the each vane and the center of the shed is 1 m. For the convenience of recording videos, the middle of the shed is a circular perspex panel (<i>R</i> = 0.6 m), the radius of the central outlet is 0.1 m. Above the outlet is the cylindrical wall, the height is 0.5 m and the radius is 0.3 m, which was used to keep the flow stable and separate the inner flow from the ambient environment. Silicone rubber plate heating system was used to provide the heat source (in <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Figure 1c</a>).</p><p>For the control and measurement, in the plate heating system, the ED330L digital display temperature control device (precision: ±1°C, setting temperature range: 30–100°C) was used to maintain the heating temperature. The heating temperature was measured by the TM-902C thermocouple (range: −50–1300°C with a resolution ratio: 0.1°C). The wind velocity was measured by TSI9515 (temperature range: −18–93°C, velocity accuracy: ±5% or ±0.025 m/s whichever is greater). In <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Figure 1b</a>, two points, M and N were selected for measuring the vertical velocity <i>U<sub>Y</sub></i> and tangential velocity <i>U<sub>τ</sub></i>, respectively.</p><p>The following experimental procedure was conducted:</p><ol id="l1" class="lcroman"><li>After measuring the environmental temperature, the heating pad A (<i>R</i> = 0.5 m) was turned on, setting a temperature difference of 50 K, 60 K, and 70 K, respectively, and measuring the corresponding vertical velocity of point M and the tangential velocity of point N. Each test took 300 s and obtained 300 values.</li><li>The heating pads A, B, and C (<i>R</i> = 1 m) were turned on, and repeated step (i).</li><li>The heating pads A, B, and C (<i>R</i> = 1 m) were turned on, and set the heating temperature to 80°C. A video (<a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Video 1.</a>) was recorded of the air flow in the shed from the vane's end to the central outlet (the whirlwind) with white smoke tracer.</li><li>Obtained the statistical average velocities of different experiments, and then compared the experimental data with numerical simulations at points M and N, respectively.</li></ol><p>On the experiment day the ambient air temperature was 13°C, the surface temperature of the heating pad was 18°C before heated.</p><p>When the heating temperature difference was 50 K, the velocities achieved under the heating pad A (the heating area, <i>R</i> = 0.5 m) and the heating pads A + B + C (the heating area, <i>R</i> = 1 m) are illustrated in the <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>, respectively.</p><p>Obviously, the wind velocity would be increased with an increase in the heating area (heating capacity). Under the heating pad A (the heating area, <i>R</i> = 0.5 m), the statistically averaged tangential and vertical velocities were obtained with heating temperature differences of 50 K, 60 K and 70 K; these are illustrated in <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#f3">Fig. 3b</a>. The simulation results with the same conditions are shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#f3">Fig. 3b</a>.</p><p><a href="/srep/2015/150209/srep08322/full/srep08322.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Video 1</a> shows the whirlwind flow at the central outlet in the experiment. In the video, a typical dust devil found in nature is shown.</p><h2>Similarity-theory estimation method</h2><p>The flow in the shed and the swirling buoyant jet are essentially a heat driven buoyant flow. The decisive forces for buoyant flow have three elements: buoyant force, inertial force and viscous force. Particularly, for the turbulent buoyant flow, the viscous force could be negligible. So the <i>Fr</i> number and the ratio of inertial force to buoyant force were taken as the similarity criterion to study the scale effect of the solar-energy-collecting shed on the velocity field of the swirling buoyant jet. The <i>Fr</i> number is defined by Equation (5):</p><p>

</p><p>Where <i>u</i><sub>0</sub> is the average resultant velocity of the swirling buoyant jet above the central outlet; <i>ρ</i><sub>0</sub> is the airflow density; <i>g</i> is the gravitational acceleration; <i>L</i> is the radius of the solar-energy-collecting shed; and <i>ρ<sub>a</sub></i> is the ambient air density.</p><p>From the similarity theory of fluid dynamics, the same <i>Fr</i> number means a similar flow in the solar-energy-collecting shed of two different sizes and their corresponding swirling buoyant jets.</p>
