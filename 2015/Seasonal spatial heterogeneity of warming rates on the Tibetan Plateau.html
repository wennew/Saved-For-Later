					<p>What created the spatial variation in the TP warming rate over the last three decades? Two features of the warming rate should be considered. One such feature is the difference above and below 33°N, the boundary between the NTP and the STP, which has also been suggested as an important “divider” between the NTP and the STP for other climatic characteristics<sup><a href="#ref10" title="Wang, N. L. The boundary between the northern and southern Tibetan Plateau with different variations in the warm season air temperatures on the decadal time scale (in Chinese with English abstract). Quat Sci. 26, 165–172 (2006)." id="ref-link-19">10</a>, <a href="#ref11" title="Duan, K. Q., Yao, T. D., Wang, N. L., Tian, L. D. &amp; Xu, B. Q. The difference in precipitation variability between the north and south Tibetan Plateaus (in Chinese with English abstract). J. Glaciology and Geocryology 30, 726–732 (2008)." id="ref-link-20">11</a></sup>. For example, the 33°N is the northern boundary of the Indian monsoon and the northernmost reach of intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) on the TP in summer<sup><a href="#ref10" title="Wang, N. L. The boundary between the northern and southern Tibetan Plateau with different variations in the warm season air temperatures on the decadal time scale (in Chinese with English abstract). Quat Sci. 26, 165–172 (2006)." id="ref-link-21">10</a></sup>. The warming rate also varies through space according to the season (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Summer saw the greatest difference in warming between the NTP and the STP, and the difference was smallest in the cold season (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f2">Figs 2a,d</a> and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f3">3</a>). To further explore the reason, we analyzed the spatial precipitation pattern for each season on the TP (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f4">Fig. 4</a>). Similar to the spatial warming rate (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>), the spatial precipitation differed noticeably above and below 33 °N on the TP in summer and the warm season (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f4">Figs 4</a>a,b and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f3">3</a>), but there was little difference in winter and the cold season (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f4">Figs 4</a>c,d and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f3">3</a>). There was a north-south difference in spring, autumn and in the annual precipitation, but the difference fell between the high summer variation and the low winter variation (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f4">Figs 4</a>e,f,g and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f3">3</a>). Moreover, there is no clear north-south boundary between precipitation patterns for the three seasons (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f4">Figs 4e,f and g</a>). Thus, the seasonal spatial heterogeneity of warming rate on the TP matches well with the north-south precipitation pattern for each season over the past 30 years (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f2">Figs 2</a>, <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f4">4</a> and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f3">3</a>). This phenomenon is further validated by the high warming rate in the dry Qaidam basin and the low warming rate in the wet southeastern TP for each season (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f2">Figs 2</a>, <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f4">4</a>).</p>

	<p>How do the seasonal warming patterns relate to the seasonal precipitation patterns on the TP? Low cloud cover may be responsible. Our analyses show that spatial patterns in low cloud cover (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f5">Fig. 5</a>) are also generally consistent with the spatial warming rates for each season (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Low could cover differs most markedly between the NTP and the STP in summer and the warm season (−22.4 ± 3.9% for summer and −20.1 ± 4.1% for the warm season) and differs least in winter and the cold season (−12.8 ± 2.9% for winter and −15.3 ± 3.2% for the cold season) (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f5">Figs 5</a> and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11725/full/srep11725.html#f3">3</a>). A synoptic analysis also demonstrated that summertime convective cloud systems on the TP mainly occurred south of 32 °N<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Chen, L. X., Song, Y. K., Liu, J. P. &amp; Wang, W.

Low clouds contain liquid droplets with a high albedo, and the low height and strong cloud-top heating prevent them from absorbing much longwave radiation<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Starr, D. O. C.

As a result, such cloud cover has a cooling effect on the atmosphere and surface below the cloud<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Starr, D. O. C.

Considering the poor coverage of meteorological stations in the western TP, understanding of the results in the region should be with caution. The spatial patterns of precipitation and low cloud cover could be the cause of the spatially heterogeneous warming rate on the TP. However, the cause of warming rate variation with time on the TP is complex and related to several factors<sup><a href="#ref8" title="Guo, D. L. &amp; Wang, H. J.
