                     <p id="p-2">The Permian mass extinction, 250 million years ago, was the worst in Earth's history, killing off some 90% of living species.
                        A team of European geoscientists has found the most direct evidence yet that ocean acidification was a major part of the die-off.
                        Scientists have long suspected that volcanoes dumped trillions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and that some
