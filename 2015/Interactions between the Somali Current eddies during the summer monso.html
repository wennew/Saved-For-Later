		<b>Interactions between the Somali Current eddies during the summer monsoon: insights from a numerical study</b><br><br>Ocean Science Discussions, 12, 735-767, 2015<br><br>Author(s): C. Q. C. Akuetevi, B. Barnier, J. Verron, J.-M. Molines, and A. Lecointre<br><br>Three hindcast simulations of the global ocean circulation
differing by resolution (1/4 or 1/12°) or
parameterization or atmospheric forcing are used to study
the fast interactions between the large anticyclonic
eddies generated by the Somali Current system during the
Southwest Monsoon. The present investigation of the
Somalian coherent eddy structures allows us to identify
the origin and the subsequent development of the cyclones
flanked upon the Great Whirl (GW) previously identified
by Beal and Donohue (2013) in satellite observations and to
establish that similar cyclones are also flanked upon the
Southern Gyre (SG). These cyclones are identified as
major actors in mixing water masses within the large
eddies and offshore the coast of Somali.
<br><br>
All three simulations bring to light that during the
period when the Southwest Monsoon is well established, the
SG moves northward along the Somali coast and encounter
the GW. The interaction between the SG and the GW is
a collision without merging, collision during which the GW
is pushed to the east of Socotra Island, sheds several
smaller patches of anticyclonic vorticity, and often
reforms into the Socotra Eddy, thus proposing a formation
mechanism for the Socotra Eddy. During this process, the
GW gives up its place to the SG which in turn becomes
a new Great Whirl. This process is robust throughout the
three simulations.
