		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>A high-resolution, 3-dimensional primitive equation model is used to investigate the cross-shelf exchange in the East China Sea (ECS). Favorable comparisons between field data and model simulations from both climatological run and hindcast run for 2006 indicate that the model has essential skills in capturing the key physics of the ECS. Temporal and spatial variations of the cross-shelf exchanges are further analyzed. It was demonstrated from both observations and simulations that in 2006 high saline water could be delivered to the north of the Changjiang River mouth (near 32ºN) as a result of stronger than typical cross-shelf exchanges at the shelf break and flows through the Taiwan Strait with an annual mean rate of 2.59 Sv and 1.83 Sv, respectively. A few new places at the shelf break were also identified where persistent and vigorous onshore or offshore exchanges occur throughout the year. Cross-shelf exchange is largely determined by the along-shelf geostrophic balance with weak seasonality, which is modulated in upper layers by northeasterly monsoon from early-fall to late-spring and at seabed by bottom friction during December − January, May and August − September. Nonlinear effect, with strong spatial variations and intra-seasonal variability, is a secondary but persistent contributor to the net seaward transport, except for northeast of Taiwan where the nonlinear effect becomes significant but more varied.
