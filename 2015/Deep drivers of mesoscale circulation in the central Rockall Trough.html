		<b>Deep drivers of mesoscale circulation in the central Rockall Trough</b><br><br>Ocean Science, 11, 343-359, 2015<br><br>Author(s): T. J. Sherwin, D. Aleynik, E. Dumont, and M. E. Inall<br><br>Mesoscale variability in the central Rockall Trough, immediately west of the

averaged surface eddy kinetic energy (EKE) has substantial inter-annual

from a maximum in May (74 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup>) to a minimum in October
(52 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup>) and has increased gradually since 1992 at about
1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup> per year. This increase may be related to the retreat

that the cyclonic component of EKE came from cold water features that are
located over 1000 m below the surface. The surface currents from altimeters
had similar magnitude to the drift currents averaged over 1000 m from the

late winter. Although the mesoscale features move in an apparent random
manner, they seem to be constrained by submarine topography such as
seamounts. Occasionally anti-cyclonic and cyclonic cells combine to cause a
coherent westward deflection of the European slope current that warms the
