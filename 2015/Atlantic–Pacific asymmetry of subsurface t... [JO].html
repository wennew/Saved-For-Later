The subsurface temperature trend, again from both observation and model, reveals an asymmetric pattern between the Atlantic and Pacific: subsurface warming is dominant over the whole ACC region in the Atlantic, while both warming and cooling are significant in the Pacific, the former located to the north of the Subantarctic Front and the latter to the south. The model reveals that the ACC has generally shifted poleward in the Atlantic, while it has shifted equatorward around Subantarctic Front and Polar Front in the Pacific. The ACC shift is consistent with the overall subsurface temperature trend.
