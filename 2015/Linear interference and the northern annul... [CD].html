Understanding the processes governing changes in the NAM on interannual and longer timescales is therefore of critical importance. Previous work reveals a consensus around the negative NAM response to El Niño events (ELN), but considerable disagreement among model projections of the NAM response to climate change (CC), despite the tropical oceans warming in both cases. This work presents numerical simulations with two atmospheric GCMs that reveal robust opposite-signed NAM responses to prescribed sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies representing ELN (negative NAM) and CC (positive NAM). The primary driver of the sign and amplitude of the NAM response is the linear interference between the planetary waves generated in response to the SST perturbations, and the climatological stationary waves. However, the linear interference framework breaks down in the case involving CC, because the total wave driving of the NAM involves a balance between a strong negative contribution from the eddies related to linear interference, and a strong positive contribution from nonlinear and higher frequency eddies. In addition, the response to CC is less robust in the two models, which may be related to the models’ parameterizations causing differences in the sensitivity to imposed SST anomalies.</p>","direction":"ltr"}};
