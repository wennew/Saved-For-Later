                        and science advocates about how Congress should oversee research funding at the National Science Foundation (NSF). That debate
                        was at full boil last week, when the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America COMPETES Act, which sets policy for

                        NSF. Both actions aim to ensure that everything NSF funds will be "in the national interest," according to the influential
                        Texas legislators behind the two bills, representatives Lamar Smith and John Culberson. But many scientists believe that the
