                        consequences, and considered so likely to occur that they have engaged all nations in risk mitigation. But now with climate
                        change, we face a slowly escalating but long-enduring global threat to food supplies, health, ecosystem services, and the
                        general viability of the planet to support a population of more than 7 billion people. The projected costs of addressing the

                        that will be necessary, an international meeting of stakeholders will convene in Paris next week (<a href="http://www.commonfuture-paris2015.org">www.commonfuture-paris2015.org</a>), ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in December, to discuss solutions for both climate mitigation
