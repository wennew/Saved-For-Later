		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Large tabular icebergs represent a disruptive influence on a stable water column when drifting in the open ocean. This is a study of one iceberg, <em>C18A</em>, encountered in the Powell Basin in the Weddell Sea in March, 2009, formed from iceberg <em>C18</em> (76 × 7 km) originating from the Ross Ice Shelf in May, 2002. <em>C18A</em> was lunate in shape with longest dimensions of 31 km × 7 km × 184 m. The meltwater field from <em>C18A</em> was characterized using <em>δ</em><sup>18</sup><em>O</em> from water samples collected near <em>C18A</em> (Near-field, 0.4-2 km) and contrasted with a <em>Far-field</em> comprised of samples from an <em>Away</em> site (19 km from <em>C18A</em>), a <em>Control</em> site (70 km away) and a region populated with small icebergs (<em>Iceberg Alley</em>, 175 km away). The in-sample fractions of meteoric water were calculated relative <em>δ</em><sup>18</sup><em>O</em> in iceberg ice and Weddell Deep Water and converted to meteoric water height (m) and a percentage within 100 m depth-bins. The the <em>Near-field</em> and <em>Far-field</em>difference from surface to 200 m was 0.51±0.28%. The concentration of meteoric water dropped to approximately half that value below 200 m, approximate keel depth of the iceberg, although detectable to 600 m. From surface to 600 m, the overall difference was statistically significant (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.0001). From this, we estimate the <em>Near-field</em> volume astern of the iceberg (0.16 km<sup>3</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) as a continuous source of meteoric water. This article is protected by copyright.
