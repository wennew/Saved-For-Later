He says:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&quot;[This paper] advanced what is known as the &quot;wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier&quot; paradigm for precipitation in global warming.

A couple even suggested the</span><a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\"><span>Fifth Assessment Report</span></a> <span>in its entirety, running to several thousands of pages. The</span> <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml\"><span>original IPCC report</span></a><span>, published in 1990, also got mentioned.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It was clear from the results that scientists tended to pick papers related to their own field. For example,</span> <a href=\"https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/edenh\"><span>Prof Ottmar Edenhofer</span></a><span>,</span> <span>chief economist at the</span> <a href=\"https://www.pik-potsdam.de/\"><span>Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research</span></a> <span>and</span> <span>co-chair of the IPCC's Working Group Three report on mitigation, selected four papers from the last 20 years on the economics of climate change costs versus risks, recent emissions trends, the technological feasibility of strong emissions reductions and the nature of international climate cooperation.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Taking a historical perspective, a few more of the early pioneers of climate science featured in our results, too. For example,</span> <span>Svante Arrhenius'</span> <span><a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786449608620846#.VUja8dpVhBc\">famous 1896 paper</a> on the Greenhouse Effect</span><span>, entitled &quot;On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground&quot;, received a couple of votes.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://law.duke.edu/fac/wiener/\"><span>Prof Jonathan Wiener</span></a><span>, environmental policy expert at Duke University in the US and lead author on the International Cooperation chapter in the IPCC's working group three report, explains why this paper should be remembered as one of the most influential in climate policy. He says:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span><span>&quot;[This is the] classic paper showing that rising greenhouse gas concentrations lead to increasing global average surface temperature.&quot;</span></span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/419111/fig5.png\"><img height=\"716\" alt=\"Fig5\" width=\"429\" src=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/419111/fig5.png\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Svante Arrhenius (1896), Philosophical Magazine</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A few decades later, a paper by</span> <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.49706427503/abstract\"><span>Guy Callendar in 1938</span></a> linked the increase in <span>carbon dioxide concentration over the previous 50 years to rising temperatures. Entitled, &quot;The artificial production of carbon dioxide and its influence on temperature,&quot; the paper marked an important step forward in climate change research, says</span> <a href=\"https://www.whoi.edu/profile/asolow/\"><span>Andrew Solow</span></a><span>, director of the Woods Hole Marine Policy centre and lead author on the detection and attribution of climate impacts chapter in the IPCC's working group two report. He says:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&quot;There is earlier work on the greenhouse effect, but not (to my knowledge) on the connection between increasing levels of CO2 and temperature.&quot;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Though it may feature in the climate change literature hall of fame, this paper raises a question about how to define a paper's influence, says Forster. Rather than being celebrated among his contemporaries, Callendar's work achieved recognition a long time after it was published. Forster says:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>&quot;I would loved to have chosen Callendar (1938) as the first attribution paper that changed the world. Unfortunately, the 1938 effort of Callendar was only really recognised afterwards as being a founding publication of the field ... The same comment applies to earlier Arrhenius and Tyndall efforts. They were only influential in hindsight.&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/419081/fig6.png\"><span><span><span><span><span><img height=\"328\" alt=\"Fig6\" width=\"600\" src=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/419081/fig6_600x328.jpg\"></span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Guy Callendar and his 1938 paper in Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Other honourable mentions in the Carbon Brief survey of most influential climate papers go to Norman Phillips,</span> <a href=\"http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/climate/class/cm2010/Phillips_QJRMS_1956.pdf\"><span>whose 1956 paper</span></a> <span>described</span> <span>the first general circulation model,</span> <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2233864?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106313720851\"><span>William Nordhaus's 1991 paper</span></a><span>on</span> <span>the economics of the greenhouse effect, and a paper by</span> <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6918/abs/nature01286.html\"><span>Camile Parmesan and Gary Yohe in 2003</span></a><span>, considered by many to provide the first formal attribution of climate change impacts on animal and plant species.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Finally,</span> <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/37/E2415.short\"><span>James Hansen's 2012 paper</span></a><span>, &quot;Public perception of climate change and the new climate dice&quot;, was important in highlighting the real-world impacts of climate change, says</span> <a href=\"http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.challinor\"><span>Prof Andy Challinor</span></a><span>, expert in climate change impacts at the University of Leeds and lead author on the food security chapter in the working group two report.

Sherwood tells Carbon Brief:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"[The paper was] the first proper computation of global warming and stratospheric cooling from enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations, including atmospheric emission and water-vapour feedback."</span></p>&#13;

He says:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"[The paper was] the first to assess the magnitude of the water vapour feedback, and was frequently cited for a good 20 years after it was published."</span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>Jumping forward a decade, a classic paper by Charles Keeling and colleagues in 1976 came in joint second place in the Carbon Brief survey.</span></p>&#13;

<blockquote>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.sterndavidi.com/"><span>Prof David Stern</span></a><span>, energy and environmental economist at the Australian National University and lead author on the Drivers, Trends and Mitigation chapter of the IPCC's working group three report, also chooses the 1976 Keeling paper, though he notes:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"This is a really tough question as there are so many dimensions to the climate problem - natural science, social science, policy etc."</span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>With the Mauna Loa measurements</span> <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/"><span>continuing today</span></a><span>, the so-called "Keeling curve" is the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide concentration in the world.

<p dir="ltr"><span>Fast forwarding a few decades, in joint second place comes a paper by Isaac Held and Brian Soden published in the journal Science in 2006.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The paper, "Robust Responses of the Hydrological Cycle to Global Warming", identified how rainfall from one place to another would be affected by climate change. Prof Sherwood, who nominated this paper as well as the winning one from Manabe and Wetherald, tells Carbon Brief why it represented an important step forward. He says:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"[This paper] advanced what is known as the "wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier" paradigm for precipitation in global warming. This mantra has been widely misunderstood and misapplied, but was the first and perhaps still the only systematic conclusion about regional precipitation and global warming based on robust physical understanding of the atmosphere."</span></p>&#13;

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Honourable mentions</strong></h3>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Rather than choosing a single paper, quite a few academics in our survey nominated one or more of the Working Group contributions to the last IPCC report. A couple even suggested the</span><a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/"><span>Fifth Assessment Report</span></a> <span>in its entirety, running to several thousands of pages. The</span> <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml"><span>original IPCC report</span></a><span>, published in 1990, also got mentioned.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>It was clear from the results that scientists tended to pick papers related to their own field. For example,</span> <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/edenh"><span>Prof Ottmar Edenhofer</span></a><span>,</span> <span>chief economist at the</span> <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/"><span>Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research</span></a> <span>and</span> <span>co-chair of the IPCC's Working Group Three report on mitigation, selected four papers from the last 20 years on the economics of climate change costs versus risks, recent emissions trends, the technological feasibility of strong emissions reductions and the nature of international climate cooperation.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Taking a historical perspective, a few more of the early pioneers of climate science featured in our results, too. For example,</span> <span>Svante Arrhenius'</span> <span><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786449608620846#.VUja8dpVhBc">famous 1896 paper</a> on the Greenhouse Effect</span><span>, entitled "On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground", received a couple of votes.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/wiener/"><span>Prof Jonathan Wiener</span></a><span>, environmental policy expert at Duke University in the US and lead author on the International Cooperation chapter in the IPCC's working group three report, explains why this paper should be remembered as one of the most influential in climate policy. He says:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground"><span><span><span>"[This is the] classic paper showing that rising greenhouse gas concentrations lead to increasing global average surface temperature."</span></span></span></p>&#13;

<p class="figurecaption" dir="ltr"><em>Svante Arrhenius (1896), Philosophical Magazine</em></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>A few decades later, a paper by</span> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.49706427503/abstract"><span>Guy Callendar in 1938</span></a> linked the increase in <span>carbon dioxide concentration over the previous 50 years to rising temperatures. Entitled, "The artificial production of carbon dioxide and its influence on temperature," the paper marked an important step forward in climate change research, says</span> <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/profile/asolow/"><span>Andrew Solow</span></a><span>, director of the Woods Hole Marine Policy centre and lead author on the detection and attribution of climate impacts chapter in the IPCC's working group two report. He says:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"There is earlier work on the greenhouse effect, but not (to my knowledge) on the connection between increasing levels of CO2 and temperature."</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though it may feature in the climate change literature hall of fame, this paper raises a question about how to define a paper's influence, says Forster. Rather than being celebrated among his contemporaries, Callendar's work achieved recognition a long time after it was published. Forster says:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground"><span><span><span><span><span>"I would loved to have chosen Callendar (1938) as the first attribution paper that changed the world. Unfortunately, the 1938 effort of Callendar was only really recognised afterwards as being a founding publication of the field ... The same comment applies to earlier Arrhenius and Tyndall efforts. They were only influential in hindsight."</span></span></span></span></span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>Finally,</span> <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/37/E2415.short"><span>James Hansen's 2012 paper</span></a><span>, "Public perception of climate change and the new climate dice", was important in highlighting the real-world impacts of climate change, says</span> <a href="http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.challinor"><span>Prof Andy Challinor</span></a><span>, expert in climate change impacts at the University of Leeds and lead author on the food security chapter in the working group two report. He says:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"[It] helped with demonstrating the strong links between extreme events this century and climate change. Result: more clarity and less hedging."</span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.ciesin.org/levy.html"><span>Marc Levi</span></a><span>, a political scientist at Columbia University and lead author on the IPCC's human security chapter, makes a wider point, telling Carbon Brief:</span></p>&#13;

<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"The importance is in showing that climate change is observable in the present."</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Indeed, attribution of extreme weather continues to be at the forefront of climate science, pushing scientists' understanding of the climate system and modern technology to their limits.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Look out for more on the latest in attribution research as Carbon Brief reports on the</span> <a href="http://www.commonfuture-paris2015.org/"><span>Our Common Futures Under Climate Change</span></a> <span>conference taking place in Paris this week.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Pinning down which climate science papers most changed the world is difficult, and we suspect climate scientists could argue about this all day.
