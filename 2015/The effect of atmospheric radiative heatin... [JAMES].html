		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>This article explores how atmospheric radiative heating, due to the presence of clouds, influences the Madden-Julian-Oscillation (MJO) as simulated by four comprehensive atmosphere general circulation models. Simulations in which clouds are transparent to electromagnetic radiation (&quot;clouds-off'') are compared with control simulations in which clouds are allowed to interact with radiation (&quot;clouds-on&quot;). Making clouds transparent to radiation leads to robust changes of the mean state: the westerly winds in the equatorial Indo-Pacific area weakens and the precipitation reveals a shift from single to double Intertropical Convergence Zones. These changes are accompanied by weaker MJOs. Also the moisture sensitivity of precipitation changes, however not consistently within our group of models.</p></div>
<div><p>Further analyses show that within the active phase of intraseasonal variability, cloud radiative effects amplify the heating profiles compared to clouds-off. Heating from non-radiative processes is dominated by the parameterized convection, but large-scale heating associated with cloud microphysical processes acting on the grid-scale modifies the shape of the heating profile, leading to a top-heaviness when cloud radiative effects are accounted for. The radiative heating due to clouds slows down the phase speed of the MJO. Averaged over the entire MJO life-cycle, the column-integrated radiative heating due to clouds lags the vertically integrated moist static energy by 40° to 60° of longitude (equivalently 7 to 10 days assuming a period of 60 days).</p></div>
<div><p>All four models studied reveal more pronounced Kelvin waves when clouds are transparent to radiation, suggesting that cloud radiative effects on large-scale heating profiles damp smaller scale, or faster, Kelvin waves and amplify MJO-like disturbances.
