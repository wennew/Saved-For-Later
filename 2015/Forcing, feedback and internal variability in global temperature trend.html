									<p>Most present-generation climate models simulate an increase in global-mean surface temperature (GMST) since 1998, whereas observations suggest a warming hiatus. It is unclear to what extent this mismatch is caused by incorrect model forcing, by incorrect model response to forcing or by random factors. Here we analyse simulations and observations of GMST from 1900 to 2012, and show that the distribution of simulated 15-year trends shows no systematic bias against the observations. Using a multiple regression approach that is physically motivated by surface energy balance, we isolate the impact of radiative forcing, climate feedback and ocean heat uptake on GMST—with the regression residual interpreted as internal variability—and assess all possible 15- and 62-year trends. The differences between simulated and observed trends are dominated by random internal variability over the shorter timescale and by variations in the radiative forcings used to drive models over the longer timescale. For either trend length, spread in simulated climate feedback leaves no traceable imprint on GMST trends or, consequently, on the difference between simulations and observations. The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.</p>

(eds Stocker, T. F. et al.) 659-740 (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2013)">46</a>. These uncertainty ranges, both of which are around 0.2 W m<sup>−2</sup> per decade, do not take into account observational biases such as those diagnosed in ref. <a href="/nature/journal/v517/n7536/full/nature14117.html#ref48" title="Ridley, D. A. et al. Total volcanic stratospheric aerosol optical depths and implications for global climate change. Geophys. Res. Lett. 41, 7763-7769 (2014)">48</a>. Despite the scatter of the CMIP5 ensemble trends, the ensemble mean is in good agreement with the AR5 best estimate for almost all start years. The AR5 best-estimate ERF sums time series of forcing across individual forcing terms. Individual time series of AR5 ERF were derived in different ways. Greenhouse gas concentrations (observed or inferred), stratospheric aerosol optical depth and total solar irradiance were used to derive estimates of radiative forcing using simple formulae. Surface albedo forcing was derived from estimated anthropogenic vegetation trends. Ozone and aerosol forcings were derived from chemical transport model results with aspects of the forcing constrained by other modelling approaches or observations, or both. ERF sums rapid adjustments with traditional radiative forcings. Most time series in AR5 were based on traditional radiative forcings, and only CO<sub>2</sub> and aerosol forcings included an assessment of the rapid adjustment. In other cases ERF and radiative forcings were assumed to be the same. The AR5 ERF for the most recent 2000–2011 period included updated estimates of volcanic and solar forcing, taking into account the broader 2008–2009 solar minimum and post-2000 volcanic activity<sup><a href="/nature/journal/v517/n7536/full/nature14117.html#ref46" title="Myhre, G. et al. in Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

These two cooling influences are not included in the CMIP5 ERF; it is hence surprising and unexplained why the CMIP5 ensemble-mean of 15-year ERF trends lies below the best-estimate AR5 ERF trend for the latest start years in <b>a</b>.</p>
