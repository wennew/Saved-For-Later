              Population movements around the Chinese New Year (CNY), which are much larger in recent years than before, are the largest annual human migration in the world. However, it is still largely unknown how or to what extent such mass human migration affects urban climate. Here, we investigate the role of mass human migration in influencing Beijing’s urban heat island (UHI) during the CNY holiday for the period of 2004–2013. We find that the UHI effects expressed as daily mean (Δ<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">T</em>
