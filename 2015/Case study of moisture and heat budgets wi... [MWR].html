Three-dimensional kinematic and thermodynamic fields were constructed using ECMWF Year of Tropical Convection data and global gridded precipitation data sets. Differences between the two ARs are observed, even though both had embedded precipitating convective organizations of the same spatial scale. AR1 extended from 20° – 50° N in almost west-east orientation. It had excessive warm and moist near-surface condition. Its precipitating systems mainly distributed in the southwest and northeast sides of the AR, and tended to exhibit stratiform type of vertical heat and moisture transports. In contrast, AR2 spanned latitudes between 20°– 60° N in north-south orientation. It was narrower and shorter than AR1, and was mostly covered by pronounced precipitating systems, dominated by deep convection type of heating throughout the troposphere. In association with these distinctions, the atmosphere over Northeastern Pacific on average experienced episodic cooling and drying despite the occurrence of AR1, yet underwent heating and drying during AR2, when latent heating was strong. Downward sensible heat flux and weak upward surface latent heat flux were observed particularly in AR1. In addition, Cloud-Radiative Forcing (CRF) was very weak in AR1, whereas it was strongly negative in AR2. In short, it is found that the oceanic convection in ARs both impacts the moisture transport of ARs, as well as modifies the heat balance in midlatitudes through latent heat release, convective heat transport, surface heat fluxes, and CRF.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><p>* </p><i>Corresponding author address:</i><p> Qianwen Luo, Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Purdue University, 550 Stadium Mall Drive, West Lafayette, IN 47907.
