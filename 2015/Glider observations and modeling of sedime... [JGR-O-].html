		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Regional sediment resuspension and transport are examined as Hurricane Sandy made landfall on the Mid Atlantic Bight (MAB) in October of 2012. A Teledyne-Webb Slocum glider, equipped with a Nortek Aquadopp current profiler, was deployed on the continental shelf ahead of the storm, and is used to validate sediment transport routines coupled to the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The glider was deployed on October 25<sup>th</sup>, 5 days before Sandy made landfall in southern New Jersey (NJ) and flew along the 40 meter isobath south of the Hudson Shelf Valley. We used optical and acoustic backscatter to compare with two modeled size classes along the glider track, 0.1 and 0.4mm sand respectively. Observations and modeling revealed full water column resuspension for both size classes for over 24 hours during peak waves and currents, with transport oriented along-shelf toward the southwest. Regional model predictions showed over 3cm of sediment eroded on the northern portion of the NJ shelf where waves and currents were the highest. As the storm passed and winds reversed from onshore to offshore on the southern portion of the domain waves and subsequently orbital velocities necessary for resuspension were reduced leading to over 3cm of deposition across the entire shelf, just north of Delaware Bay. This study highlights the utility of gliders as a new asset in support of the development and verification of regional sediment resuspension and transport models, particularly during large tropical and extra-tropical cyclones when <em>in situ</em> datasets are not readily available.
