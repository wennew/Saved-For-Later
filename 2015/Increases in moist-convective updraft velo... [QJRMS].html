		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The scaling of updraft velocities over a wide range of surface temperatures is investigated in simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with a cloud-system resolving model. The updraft velocities increase with warming, with the largest fractional increases occurring in the upper troposphere and for the highest percentile updrafts. A plume model approximately reproduces the increases in updraft velocities if the plume environment is prescribed as the mean profile in each simulation while holding the entrainment and microphysical assumptions fixed. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) also increases with warming in the simulations but at a much faster fractional rate when compared with the square of the updraft velocities. This discrepancy is investigated with a two-plume model in which a weakly-entraining plume represents the most intense updrafts, and the environment is assumed to adjust so that a more strongly-entraining plume has negligible buoyancy. The two-plume model suggests that updraft velocities increase with warming at a lower rate than implied by the CAPE because of the influence of entrainment on both the mean stratification and the updrafts themselves.</p></div>
