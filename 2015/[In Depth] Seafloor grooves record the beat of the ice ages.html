                        studies published this week. At seafloor spreading centers, plates of ocean crust diverge and magma erupts in the gap, building
                        new crust onto the plates' trailing edges. Parallel to these spreading centers are "abyssal hills": long, 100-meter-high ridges
                        on the diverging plates, separated by valleys. It turns out that these periodic grooves reflect the timing of the ice ages.
