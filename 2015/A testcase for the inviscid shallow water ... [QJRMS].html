		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>A numerically converged solution to the inviscid global shallow water equations on a predefined time interval is documented to provide a convenient benchmark for model validation. The solution is based on the same initial conditions as a previously documented solution for the viscous equations. The solution is computed using two independent numerical schemes, one a pseudospectral scheme based on an expansion in spherical harmonics, the other a finite-volume scheme on a cubed-sphere grid. Flow fields and various integral norms are both documented to facilitate model comparison and validation. Attention is drawn to the utility of the potential vorticity supremum as a convenient and sensitive test of numerical convergence, in which the exact value is known <i>a priori</i> over the entire time interval.</p></div>
