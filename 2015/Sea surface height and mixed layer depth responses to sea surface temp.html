		<b>Sea surface height and mixed layer depth responses to sea surface temperature in northwestern Pacific subtropical front zone from spring to summer</b><br><br>Ocean Science Discussions, 12, 83-101, 2015<br><br>Author(s): C. Qiu, H. Kawamura, H. Mao, and J. Wu<br><br>Qiu et al. (2014) quantitatively examined the mechanisms of sea surface
temperature front disappearance, finding that the formation of shallow mixed
layer depth (MLD) is very important. In the present study, we further
investigated variations of the sea level anomaly (SLA) and mixed layer depth (MLD) during the SST front weakening period, based on weekly satellite
derived products. For the SLA, we examined the steric height component of
SLA, using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method and physical method.
The seasonal variations of steric height from above two methods have the
same pattern: peak value (~ 20 cm) occurs in July-August, and
minimum value (~ −5 cm) occurs in February to March.
Correlation between SLA and SST achieves 0.76 in cold zone and frontal zone,
and it is 0.86 between steric component and SST. When SST becomes large, MLD
decreases gradually. The linear relationship (<i>y</i> = −4.46 <i>x</i> +156.47) between
MLD and SST could be used to estimate the MLD in the subtropical front zone.
