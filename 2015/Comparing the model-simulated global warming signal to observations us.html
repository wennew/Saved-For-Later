In the context of societal concerns regarding global warming, it can be useful to consider the component of GMT change that is due to external radiative forcings as the ‘signal’ and the component due to chaotic unforced variability as ‘noise’ and thus we adopt this convention here.</p><p>Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (CGCMs) are the most common tools used to estimate how GMT responds to external radiative forcings. However, a single externally forced CGCM run will contain both a forced signal and unforced noise produced by the CGCM. The unforced noise produced by multiple runs of CGCMs with different initial conditions will be independent so the forced signal of a CGCM can be isolated by averaging over many CGCM ensemble members. Thus, in this study we use the multi-model mean across numerous CGCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projection – Phase 5 (CMIP5)<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Taylor, K. E., Stouffer, R.

Therefore, when the forced signal produced by CGCMs is compared to the observed GMT, it is important to consider the probability distribution of GMT values that would have been possible had the climate system been in a different unforced state. We refer to the probability distribution of GMT values that could come about due to unforced variability as the Envelope of Unforced Noise (EUN). Note that the EUN always represents a range of variability about some background GMT value that is fundamentally controlled by the external radiative forcings.</p><p>Several recent studies have compared observed GMT anomalies (and trends) with the forced signal and EUN produced by an ensemble of CGCM runs<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Easterling, D.

Hypothetically, if the observed GMT anomaly were to fall below the CGCM-produced EUN, it would not necessarily indicate that the forced signal was increasing too rapidly. Instead, it could indicate that the CGCM-produced EUN is not large enough (i.e., that CGCMs underestimate the magnitude of unforced noise but not the magnitude of the forced rate of warming). On the other hand, if the CGCM-produced EUN is too large (i.e., if CGCMs overestimate the magnitude of unforced noise compared to reality), then recent observations may already confirm that the forced signal over the 21<sup>st</sup> century is increasing too rapidly.</p><p>The unforced noise produced by CGCMs is an emergent property of the simulations and is not guaranteed to accurately represent empirical observations.

We then use this EUN to revisit two topics that are relevant to the interpretation of recent climate change: 1) Is the interdecadal variability in the rate of global warming over the 20<sup>th</sup> century (i.e., warming from the 1910s-1940s, a hiatus from the 1940s-1970s and resumed warming from the 1970s-2000s) large enough so that it necessitates corresponding changes in external radiative forcings? Alternatively, could this variability be the result of unforced noise superimposed on a more-or-less constantly increasing forced signal? 2) Does the reduced rate of global warming over the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century indicate that the CMIP5 CGCM-produced forced signal is increasing too rapidly or are hiatus periods like this more-or-less inevitable?</p><p>For the purpose of answering these questions, we create an Ensemble of Stochastic Realizations of Unforced Noise (ESRUN) which is a collection of thousands of synthetic time series produced using 2<sup>nd</sup> order autoregressive, AR(2), noise models (see Methods). The high frequency (interannual to decadal) variability in these time series is based on the instrumental GMT record, which extends from the present to the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Unfortunately, the instrumental record may be insufficient to serve as the basis for low frequency (interdecadal to centennial) variability in the ESRUN because it is too short to properly characterize this variability. Additionally, the instrumental record overlaps with the era of strong anthropogenic radiative forcing. This overlap has created ambiguity as to whether observed interdecadal variability in GMT during the 20<sup>th</sup> century is attributable to corresponding variations in external forcings or to unforced noise. Some studies emphasize the role of time-varying external forcings<sup><a href="#ref36" title="Hansen, J. et al. Earth's Energy Imbalance: Confirmation and Implications.

	<p>There is considerable uncertainty around both the reconstructed surface temperature anomalies as well as the reconstructed forcings from the year 1000 to 1850. We account for this uncertainty by sampling different combinations of estimated forcing (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#f1">Fig. 1a</a>) and surface temperature (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#f1">Fig. 1b</a>) time series in our creation of different estimates of historical unforced GMT noise (U<sub>recon</sub> time series) (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#f1">Fig. 1c</a>). Additionally, many reconstructions of surface temperature over the past millennium are limited to a single hemisphere and there are few reconstructions of GMT. However, analysis of CGCMs indicates that information on GMT variability can be gleaned from the variability of a single hemisphere (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. S4</a>). In particular, these CGCMs indicate that GMT variability tends to originate relatively coherently from both hemispheres (often due to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation which spans both the northern and southern Pacific Ocean)<sup><a href="#ref33" title="Brown, P. T., Li, W. &amp; Xie, S.-P. Regions of significant influence on unforced global mean surface air temperature variability in climate models. Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 2014JD022576, 10.1002/2014JD022576 (2014)." id="ref-link-70">33</a></sup>. Therefore, larger variability in one hemisphere tends to imply larger GMT variability (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. S4</a>). Thus, we use the information from the hemispheric reconstructions to infer GMT variability by converting hemispheric estimates of unforced noise into estimates of unforced GMT noise with scaling factors derived from CGCMs (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Table S1, Methods</a>). Sampling uncertainty in the reconstructed surface temperatures, reconstructed forcings, and the conversion of hemispheric to global variability, yielded an ensemble of 15,120 U<sub>recon</sub> time series, each representing a different possible progression of low frequency unforced GMT anomalies from the years 1000 to 1850 (a representative sample of these U<sub>recon</sub> time series are shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#f1">Fig. 1d</a>). The ESRUN consisted of AR(2) models that simulated low frequency variability based on each of the 15,120 U<sub>recon</sub> time series and combined that with AR(2) models that simulated high frequency variability based on the instrumental record (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. S3, Methods</a>). The ESRUN was then used to create a EUN characterized by the 0.5–99.5%, 2.5-97.5%, and 5-95% GMT ranges across all of the stochastic time series as a function of time (<a href="/srep/2015/150421/srep09957/full/srep09957.html#f1">Fig. 1e</a>).</p>
