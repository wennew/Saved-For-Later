					<h2>Growing emissions from 1997 to 2007</h2><p>Between 1997 and 2007, US emissions increased by 7.3<span class="mb">%</span> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, black curve). Our analysis shows that the main factor behind this increase was an increase in consumption volume caused by growth in per capita consumption of goods and services in the United States. Indeed, increases in such consumption volume correspond to a contribution of a 21.8<span class="mb">%</span> increase in emissions over this decade (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, red curve). The next most important factor influencing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over the same period was population growth. Immigration and natural growth have resulted in steady population growth at a rate of ~1<span class="mb">%</span> per year since 1997. These population gains contributed to an 8.9<span class="mb">%</span> increase in emissions between 1997 and 2007 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, yellow curve).</p>

	<p>However, other factors slowed the growth of emissions between 1997 and 2007: decreases in the energy intensity of GDP; changes in the consumption patterns of US consumers; shifts in production structure; and decreases in the use of coal as an energy source. For instance, over this period, the energy used per dollar of economic output decreased by 17<span class="mb">%</span> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>, black curve), the share of consumer spending on manufactured goods decreased by ~4<span class="mb">%</span> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2b</a>), the share of imported inputs to the US industry sectors increased (for example, imports to petroleum and coal products sector increased by 6.7<span class="mb">%</span>, and imports to the chemical products, primary metals and textile sectors increased by 2.7<span class="mb">%</span>, 2.5<span class="mb">%</span> and 2.1<span class="mb">%</span>, respectively)<sup><a href="#ref11" title="BEA., Input-Output Data. U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2014) ." id="ref-link-11">11</a></sup>, and the share of US electricity generated from coal decreased by ~5<span class="mb">%</span> while the share generated from natural gas increased by 8<span class="mb">%</span> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). All of these trends exerted a downward influence on emissions. Between 1997 and 2007, changes in energy intensity, consumption patterns, production structure and fuel mix contributed to retarding emissions of 7.4, 6.9, 4.9 and 3.6<span class="mb">%</span>, respectively (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, purple, green, blue and orange curves, respectively).</p>

	<h2>Declining emissions from 2007 to 2013</h2><p>US CO<sub>2</sub> emissions stopped growing in 2007, and decreased by ~11<span class="mb">%</span> between 2007 and 2013 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, black curve). Looking at this time period in aggregate, the only factor which acted to increase emissions over the period was continued and steady population growth (<span class="mb">+</span>3.7<span class="mb">%</span>) (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, yellow curve). However, the upward influence of population growth was overwhelmed by the downward influence of changes in production structure (−6.1<span class="mb">%</span>), fuel mix (−4.4<span class="mb">%</span>), consumption volumes triggered by per capita consumption (−3.9<span class="mb">%</span>), energy intensity of GDP (−0.5<span class="mb">%</span>) and changing consumption patterns (−0.4<span class="mb">%</span>; <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, blue, orange, red, purple and green curves, respectively).</p><p>Although all of the analysed factors except population contributed to the decrease in emissions during 2007–2013, different factors dominated over shorter periods. <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Figure 3</a> subdivides 2007-2013 into 2-year periods, showing that emissions fell by 9.9<span class="mb">%</span> from 2007 to 2009, increased by 1.3<span class="mb">%</span> between 2009 to 2011 and decreased again by 2.1<span class="mb">%</span> between 2011 and 2013.</p>

				<div class="description"><p>Between 2007 and 2009, decreases in the volume of goods and services consumed during the economic recession (red) was the primary contributor to the nearly 10<span class="mb">%</span> drop in emissions.

Between 2011 and 2013, increases in population and consumption volume again pushed emissions upward, but overall emissions decreased by 2.1<span class="mb">%</span> due to further changes in production (prod.) structure, consumption patterns, decreasing use of coal and decreases in energy intensity of output. Not shown here, emissions increased by 1.7<span class="mb">%</span> between 2012 and 2013, driven primarily by increases in consumption volume.</p></div>

	<p>More than half (53<span class="mb">%</span>) of the initial and most substantial decrease in emissions, between 2007 and 2009, was due to a sharp drop in the volume of consumed goods as a result of reduction in per capita consumption during the global economic recession (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>, red bar). In particular, <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f4">Fig. 4</a> shows that sharp decreases in the volume of capital expenditures and exported goods between 2007 and 2009 drove down associated emissions by 25<span class="mb">%</span> and 18<span class="mb">%</span>, respectively. Changes in the production structure of the US economy (that is, the volume and type of intermediate goods demanded) and the fuel mix of the energy sector contributed 30<span class="mb">%</span> and 17<span class="mb">%</span> of the initial (2007–2009) decrease in emissions, respectively, while increases in the energy intensity of the US economy and changing consumption patterns exerted modest upward influences on emissions during the same period.</p>

	<p>As the US economy had slowly recovered from the global economic recession, between 2009 and 2013, the average annual change in US emissions was small: a 0.2<span class="mb">%</span> decrease. Economic recovery is reflected by the upward influence of the volume of goods consumed on emissions during both 2009–2011 and 2011–2013. Between 2009 and 2011, rising consumption volume, population growth, and increasing energy intensity urged emissions up by a combined 4.0<span class="mb">%</span> (2.2<span class="mb">%</span>, 1.5<span class="mb">%</span> and 0.3<span class="mb">%</span>, respectively), which was only partly offset by the changes in consumption patterns (−1.1<span class="mb">%</span>), production structure (−1.0<span class="mb">%</span>) and fuel mix (−0.6<span class="mb">%</span>), resulting in an actual increase in emissions of 1.3<span class="mb">%</span> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>). However, between 2011 and 2013, the upward influence of consumption volume and population on emissions was less (<span class="mb">+</span>1.2<span class="mb">%</span> and <span class="mb">+</span>1.2<span class="mb">%</span>, respectively) and the energy intensity of the economy decreased (−2.1<span class="mb">%</span>). When combined with changes in the fuel mix of the energy sector (−1.2<span class="mb">%</span>) and shifting consumption patterns (−0.2<span class="mb">%</span>), the net effect was a 2.1<span class="mb">%</span> decrease in emissions during 2011–2013 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>).</p><p>Increases in the supply of natural gas affect two of the factors in our analysis: the fuel mix of the energy sector and, to a lesser extent, the energy intensity of the US economy. By decreasing gas prices, abundant gas encourages a shift in the fuel mix from more carbon-intensive coal to gas. In turn, a shift to gas may contribute to decreased energy intensity because gas-fired power plants are on average 20<span class="mb">%</span> more efficient at converting fuel energy to electricity than coal plants<sup><a href="#ref12" title="EIA. International Energy Statistics. U.S. Energy Information Administration (2014) ." id="ref-link-12">12</a></sup>.</p><p>The boom of natural gas from breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing of shale deposits had only just begun to affect US gas supplies in 2009 (ref. <a href="#ref5" title="Joskow, P. L. Natural gas: from shortages to abundance in the United States. Am. Econ. Rev. 103, 338-343 (2013) ." id="ref-link-13">5</a>). Thus, the decrease in emissions from changes in the fuel mix of the energy sector prior 2009 reflects an independent and longer-term trend of the declining use of coal in the US energy sector (see, for example, <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). However, as seen in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>, changes in the US fuel mix from 2007 to 2009 alone would not have caused a decrease in US emissions.</p><p>Although the decreases in emissions since 2009 have been relatively small, the influence of shale gas is visible. For example, about half of the 2.1<span class="mb">%</span> decrease in emissions during 2011–2013 is related to changes in the fuel mix of the energy sector (−1.2<span class="mb">%</span>, orange bar in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>). Yet the decrease in the energy intensity of the US economy was nearly twice as strong an influence on emissions over the same period (purple bar in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>).</p><p>Although a drop in the energy intensity (exajoule per dollar output) of the energy sector in 2013 accounts for roughly a third of the observed decrease in US energy intensity in 2011–2013, the remaining two-thirds relate to changes in energy used by the transport and service sectors (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>). Three unrelated trends underlie the decreasing energy intensity of these sectors. First, high gasoline prices during 2011–2013 (the average price of gasoline had remained above <span class="mb">$</span>3.40 per gallon during this period, in contrast to the average price of <span class="mb">$</span>2.50 per gallon in 2005) have contributed to both a reduction in per capita miles driven (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1a</a>) and an increase in average fuel efficiency of vehicles (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1b</a>), and thus a 33<span class="mb">%</span> decrease in US gasoline consumption during 2011–2013. Second, a mild winter in 2012 meant less energy was used for heating and thus reduced energy intensity of the service sector (households also used less energy for home heating, which accounts for part of the drop in consumption volume)<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Afsah, S. &amp; Salcito, K. Demand Reduction Slashes US CO2 Emissions in 2012. CO2 Scorecard Group (2013) ." id="ref-link-14">13</a></sup> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>). Last, there is evidence that manufacturing in the United States became more energy efficient: energy use by manufacturing was nearly constant 2011–2013 despite average annual growth in GDP of 2.3<span class="mb">%</span> per year over the same period.</p><p>Shifts in the production structure of the US economy between 2007 and 2013 have consistently exerted a downward influence on US emissions, as the volume and type of intermediate goods used by various industry sectors has evolved and become more efficient (blue bars in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>). Yet this structural shift also reflects the progressive offshoring of emissions-intensive industries to China and other developing countries over the analysed period<sup><a href="#ref14" title="Peters, G. P., Davis, S. J. &amp; Andrew, R. A synthesis of carbon in international trade. Biogeosciences 9, 3949-4023 (2012) ." id="ref-link-15">14</a></sup>. For instance, between 2009 and 2011, when changes in domestic production structure exerted a downward influence on US CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (−1<span class="mb">%</span>, blue bar in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>), we calculated that the net import of emissions embodied in US trade increased by 32<span class="mb">%</span> (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). Trade data for the 2011–2013 period is not yet available.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2013, the share of US consumption of manufactured goods increased relative to services (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2b</a>), but the net effect of changes in consumption patterns was to decrease emissions (by 1.1<span class="mb">%</span> between 2009 and 2011 and by 0.2<span class="mb">%</span> between 2011 and 2013; green bars in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>). This result reveals that changes in the types of goods being consumed over time can have a significant impact on emissions<sup><a href="#ref15" title="Peters, G. P., Weber, C.

The recessionary belt-tightening may also have contributed to the significant efficiency gains in production structure.</p><p>Since 2009, the slow recovery of the US economy has urged emissions backup, but has been closely balanced by decreases in energy intensity, especially in the transport, manufacturing and service sectors (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>), as well as changes in the fuel mix of the energy sector. The net effect has been very little change in emissions; between 2009 and 2013; US emissions have decreased by an average of 0.2<span class="mb">%</span> per year. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our decomposition analysis shows that changes in the fuel mix of the energy sector (including those related to the shale gas boom) account for a relatively small portion of this decrease.</p><p>In addition to a more robust understanding of the factors influencing US emissions during 1997–2013, our analysis may be helpful in assessing the efficacy of different forces to reduce US emissions in the future. For example, the modest effect of changes in the fuel mix of the energy sector on emissions in recent years suggests that further increase in the use of natural gas may be of limited benefit in decreasing emissions. This is because barring technology-specific policies (for example, Renewable Portfolio Standards), recent studies have shown that gas does not substitute for coal only; growth of emission-free technologies such as solar, wind and nuclear energy is also limited while gas is cheap<sup><a href="#ref17" title="McJeon, H. et al.

Climate change: a crack in the natural-gas bridge. Nature 514, 436-437 (2014) ." id="ref-link-19">18</a></sup>. In these studies, future increases in natural gas use act to both reduce domestic coal use and slow the growth of renewable energy, resulting in little net change to cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions<sup><a href="#ref17" title="McJeon, H. et al.

The effect of natural gas supply on US renewable energy and CO2 emissions. Environ. Res. Lett. 9, 094008 (2014) ." id="ref-link-23">21</a></sup>. Moreover, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are not the only consideration; a growing number of studies also show that increased leakage of methane from new natural gas infrastructure can offset CO<sub>2</sub> reductions relative to coal<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Wigley, T. M. L. Coal to gas: the influence of methane leakage. Clim. Change 108, 601-608 (2011) ." id="ref-link-24">22</a>, <a href="#ref23" title="Brandt, A. R. et al.

Third, decreases in residential gas prices (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>) may lead to rebound effects if people spend some of the money they saved heating their home on carbon- and energy-intensive goods<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Ornetzeder, M., Hertwich, E. G., Hubacek, K., Korytarova, K. &amp; Haas, W. The environmental effect of car-free housing: a case in Vienna. Ecol. Econ. 65, 516-530 (2008) ." id="ref-link-26">24</a></sup>. And finally, decreased domestic demand for coal has enabled an increase in US coal exports to eager and growing overseas markets. The US power sector consumed 170 million fewer metric tons of coal in 2013 than in 2007, during which period coal exports doubled even as coal prices rose (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5</a>). Although CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from US coal burned elsewhere are generally attributed to the country where those emissions occur, the emissions nonetheless contribute to global climate change (and in fact less energy may be produced per unit of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions when the coal is burned in countries with less-efficient power plants). For all these reasons, further increases in the use of natural gas in the United States may not have a large effect on global greenhouse gas emissions and warming.</p><p>Similarly, further emissions reductions due to decreases in energy intensity are not inevitable. As can be seen in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>, the energy intensity of utilities increased between 2009 and 2013, perhaps because such utilities chose to pass the cost savings related to cheap gas along to their customers<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Sirkin, H., Zinser, M. &amp; Rose, J. How Cheap Natural Gas Benefits the Budgets of U.S. Households. The Boston Consulting Group (2014) ." id="ref-link-27">25</a></sup>. The energy intensity of other industry sectors also shows no long-term decreasing trend (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>). In contrast, any gas-driven recovery of US manufacturing, such as in the production of vehicles and heavy machinery<sup><a href="#ref26" title="Plumer, B. Is U.S.manufacturing making a comeback [mdash] or is it just hype? In: The Washington Post The Washington Post (2013) ." id="ref-link-28">26</a></sup>, will tend to increase the average energy intensity of the US economy.</p><p>Sustaining economic growth while also drastically reducing emissions to the levels targeted by the Obama administration<sup><a href="#ref27" title="Samuelsohn, D. &amp; Friedman, L. Obama Announces 2020 Emissions Target, Dec. 9 Copenhagen Visit. In: New York Times (2009) ." id="ref-link-29">27</a></sup> will depend upon large additional decreases in the energy intensity of the US economy as well as radical decarbonization of the energy sector (that is, very large changes in the fuel mix of the energy sector away from fossil fuels and toward renewables and/or nuclear energy). Although increased use of natural gas by the energy sector has helped to keep US CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from rising during the economic recovery of 2009–2013, our decomposition analysis shows that decreases in the energy intensity of the manufacturing, transport and service sectors over the same period were even more important, and that the largest decrease in emissions was due to decreased consumption during the recession of 2007–2009. However, the recovering economy is now urging emissions backup, it is not clear whether decreases in energy intensity will continue, and the overall climate benefits of increased gas use are in question. Future reductions in US emissions will depend upon policies (for example, the Environmental Protection Agency Clean Power Plan) that can lock-in the recessionary emissions reductions and ensure continued decarbonization of the US energy system by deployment of more efficient and low-carbon energy technologies<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Davis, S.
