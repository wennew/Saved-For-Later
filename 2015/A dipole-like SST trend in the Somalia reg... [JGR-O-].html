		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>SST trends measured in the Somalia region during the southwest monsoon season over the period 1982-2013 have shown the existence of a warming-cooling dipole. The positive spot, with a warming trend on the order of 0.37ºC dec<sup>-1</sup>, is centered around 5.1 ºN – 50.3º E and the negative one, with a trend on the order of -0.43ºC dec<sup>-1</sup>, around 11.1 ºN – 52.2º E. The migration of the Great Whirl (GW) over the last three decades at a speed of -0.3 deg dec<sup>-1</sup> in longitude and -0.6 deg dec<sup>-1</sup> in latitude was considered as the possible origin of the SST dipole. The displacement of the GW produces changes in the geostrophic currents which, in turn, generate changes in the amount of advected water from and to coast. This article is protected by copyright.
