The MEDTRANS climatology gives more details of the distribution of
water characteristics in the subtropical northeastern Atlantic than other
alternative climatologies and is able to reproduce a number of dynamic
features described in the literature: the acceleration in the meanders of the
Azores current; the cyclonic gyre in the Gulf of Cadiz; and the splitting and
separation of the Mediterranean Water (MW) outflow in two veins near the
Gorringe and Galicia banks. Seasonal climatologies, computed for the warm
(May–October) and cold (November–April) seasons, reveal stronger zonal
extension of the upper ocean patterns during the warm season, as compared to
the cold one.
