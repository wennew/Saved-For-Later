                           <p id="p-2" class="flushleft">Many regions of the subtropical and tropical continents such as southern Amazonia, Australia, and the southwestern and central
                              United States, have repeatedly experienced extreme droughts over the past few decades, and accompanied by an increasing wetness
                              over the equatorial regions. These phenomena seems to be consistent with an apparent intensified and poleward expansion of
                              the tropical meridional circulation (<span class="xref-bibr">1</span>, <span class="xref-bibr">2</span>), i.e., the Hadley Circulation (HC) observed in recent decades. However, most global climate models, including those that
                              participated in the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth and Fifth Assessments (CMIP3 and CMIP5), have
                              suggested that the HC will become weaker with a future warmer climate. Thus, it has not been known whether the intensified
                              droughts and wet anomalies in the tropics have been a result of recurring natural climate variability on a decadal time scale
                              or a trend forced by increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Lau and Kim (<span class="xref-bibr">3</span>) find, in climate models for the first time, an intensification of the HC induced by CO<sub>2</sub> warming.

                           <p id="p-3">As the globally annually averaged latitudinal circulation over the tropics and subtropics, the HC features rising air centered
                              a few degrees north of the equator and almost 25° in width and a large seasonal reversing component associated with monsoons
                              (<span class="xref-bibr">4</span>). The subsidence of the air required by mass balance, occurs in the subtropics (15°–40° N/S), converging in the lower troposphere
                              toward the rising branch of the HC and diverging away from it in the upper troposphere (Fig. 1<em>A</em>). The HC is named after George Hadley, an English lawyer and amateur meteorologist, who identified it as the atmospheric
                              mechanism by which the Trade Winds are sustained, a key factor in the early 18th century in ensuring that European sailing
                              vessels reached North American shores. The HC influences the latitudinal distributions of rainfall, …
