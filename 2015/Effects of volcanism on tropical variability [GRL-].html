		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The effects of large tropical volcanic eruptions on Indo-Pacific tropical variability are investigated using 122 historical ensemble members from CMIP5. Radiative forcing due to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is found to increase the likelihood of a model climatic response that projects onto both the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode. Large eruptions are associated with co-occurring El Niño and positive IOD events in the ensemble means that peak 6–12 months after the volcanic forcing peaks, marking a significant increase in the likelihood of each event occurring in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) spring/summer post-eruption. There is also an ensemble mean La Niña-like response in the third SHsummer post-eruption, which coincides with a significant increase in the likelihood of a La Niña occurring. Taken together with the initial cooling, this La Niña-like response may increase the persistence of the cool global-average surface temperature anomaly after an eruption.</p></div>
