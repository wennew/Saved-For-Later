<p>The hiatus lives.</p>
<p><span id="more-19282"/></p>
<p>The recent paper by Karl et al., discussed at <a href="http://judithcurry.com/2015/06/04/has-noaa-busted-the-pause-in-global-warming/">Has NOAA busted the pause in global warming?</a>, presented a new surface temperature data set that does NOT support the notion of a ‘slowdown’ in global surface temperature increase.  Karl et al. found a global trend 2000-2014 to be 0.116C/decade, with an ocean trend of 0.99C/decade.  The paper received a HUGE amount of publicity.</p>
<p>A new paper published by <em>Science</em> is just what I have been waiting for, an integrative look at global ocean data in recent decades:</p>
<p><strong>Recent hiatus caused by decadal shift in Indo-Pacific heating</strong></p>
<p>Veronical Nieves, Josh Willis, William Patzert</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract.</strong>  Recent modeling studies have proposed different scenarios to explain the slowdown in surface temperature in the most recent decade. Some of these studies seem to support the idea of internal variability and/or rearrangement of heat between the surface and the ocean interior. Others suggest that radiative forcing might also play a role. Our examination of observational data over the past two decades shows some significant differences compared to model results from reanalyses, and provides the most definitive explanation of how the heat was redistributed. We find that cooling in the top 100-meter layer of the Pacific Ocean was mainly compensated by warming in the 100- to 300-meter layer of the Indian and Pacific Oceans in the past decade since 2003.</em></p>
<p>The paper is published in Science [<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/07/08/science.aaa4521.abstract">link</a>].</p>
<p>Some excerpts:</p>
<p><em>The global average surface temperature has been rising since 2003 by +0.001°C/year. Although not zero, it is slower than the century time-scale warming of +0.0064 ± 0.0015°C/year since 1880 (2).

<p><strong>JC comment:</strong>  The last sentence in the paper is the only statement in the paper that I disagree with.  Their analysis is not sufficient to close the global energy budget or to rule out a change in external forcing or cloudiness in contributing to the hiatus.</p>
<p><strong>JC reflections</strong></p>
<p>This paper is important in clarifying the vertical and horizontal distribution of subsurface temperature changes in the ocean.  And I am particularly glad to be reminded of the OI SST data set, which may be the best SST data set to use for recent decades.  The hiatus clearly lives, both in upper ocean heat content and surface temperatures from OI SST data set.  The Karl et al. ocean data seems inconsistent with the upper ocean heat content measurements (not to mention the OI SST data set).  I am also relieved to see a careful comparison of the ocean reanalyses (e.g. NCEP, ECMWF) with observations, highlighting the deficiencies of the NCEP and ECMWF ocean reanalyses relative to observations.  Rather extravagant and overconfident claims have been made about the ocean reanalyses, which are unjustified based on the actual observations.</p>
<p>This paper lays out a challenge not only for ocean reanalysis, but for also improving model treatment of vertical heat transfer in the ocean.</p>
<p>Well, it will certainly be interesting to see what the media does with this paper, after declaring the hiatus an artifact several weeks ago.  This new paper, published in the same journal as the Karl paper (<em>Science</em>), should have come to the attention of the same journalists as the Karl paper (although I did not see any press release associated with this paper).  I received an advanced copy of the paper from someone in a skeptics organization – no queries from journalists or anything.  It will be interesting to see how (or if) this paper plays out in the mainstream media.</p>
