		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Climate change can influence sea surface conditions and the melting rates of ice sheets; resulting in decreased deep water formation rates and ultimately affecting the strength of the AMOC. As such, a detailed study of the interactive role of dynamic ice sheets on the AMOC and therefore on global climate is required. We utilize a climate model in combination with a dynamic ice sheet model to investigate changes to the AMOC and North Atlantic climate in response to IPCC scenarios for RCP4.5 and RCP6. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of an ice sheet component results in a drastic freshening of the North Atlantic by up to 2 psu, enhancing high latitude haloclines, and weakening the AMOC by up to 2 Sv. Incorporating a bi-directionally coupled dynamic ice sheet results in relatively reduced warming over Europe due to the associated decrease in heat transport.</p></div>
