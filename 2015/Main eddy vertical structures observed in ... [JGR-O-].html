		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>In the 4 major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS), mesoscale eddies are known to modulate the biological productivity and transport near-coastal seawater properties toward the offshore ocean, however little is known about their main characteristics and vertical structure. This study combines 10 years of satellite-altimetry data and Argo float profiles of temperature and salinity, and our main goals are <em>i</em>) to describe the main surface characteristics of long-lived eddies formed in each EBUS and their evolution, and <em>ii</em>) to depict the main vertical structure of the eddy-types that co-exist in these regions. A clustering analysis of the Argo profiles surfacing within the long-lived eddies of each EBUS allows us to determine the proportion of surface and subsurface-intensified eddies in each region, and to describe their vertical structure in terms of temperature, salinity and dynamic height anomalies. In the Peru–Chile Upwelling System, 55% of the sampled anticyclonic eddies (AEs) have subsurface-intensified maximum temperature and salinity anomalies below the seasonal pycnocline, whereas 88% of the cyclonic eddies (CEs) are surface-intensified. In the California Upwelling System, only 30% of the AEs are subsurface-intensified and all of the CEs show maximum anomalies above the pycnocline. In the Canary Upwelling System, ∼40% of the AEs and ∼60% of the CEs are subsurface-intensified with maximum anomalies extending down to 800 m depth. Finally, the Benguela Upwelling System tends to generate ∼40-50% of weak surface-intensified eddies and ∼50-60% of much stronger subsurface-intensified eddies with a clear geographical distribution. The mechanisms involved in the observed eddy vertical shapes are discussed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>
