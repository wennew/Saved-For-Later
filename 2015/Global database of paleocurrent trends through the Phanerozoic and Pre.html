Potter and Pettijohn’s classic work<sup><a id="ref-link-section-1" title=" Potter, P. E. &amp; Pettijohn, F. J. Paleocurrents and Basin Analysis. (Springer, 1977). " href="/articles/sdata201525#ref1">1</a></sup>, published first in 1963, framed the rapid expansion of interest in paleocurrents seen in the geological literature, as sedimentologists and petroleum geologists recognized the usefulness of paleocurrents for establishing provenance and defining sedimentary basins. Paleocurrents also played a significant role in establishing plate tectonics as a viable model<sup><a id="ref-link-section-2" title=" Bigarella, J. J. Paleocurrents and the problem of continental drift. Geol. Rundsch. 62, 447–477 (1973). " href="/articles/sdata201525#ref2">2</a></sup>.</p><p>This project began as an outgrowth of an assignment in a graduate sedimentology class using Potter and Pettijohn’s book. Students were challenged to recover paleocurrent data from the published literature and to use that data to test models of basinal sedimentation. The results encouraged us to continue the study. In particular, this pursuit was stimulated by the textbook authors’ challenge: ‘An aspect of paleocurrents, still far from being exploited, is compilation of more region-wide paleocurrent and facies maps... of regions exceeding a thousand or more kilometres in length and width<sup><a id="ref-link-section-3" title=" Potter, P. E. &amp; Pettijohn, F. J. Paleocurrents and Basin Analysis, 348 (Springer, 1977). " href="/articles/sdata201525#ref3">3</a></sup>’. To accomplish this objective would require the accumulation of data on a heretofore unavailable scope. This we sought to accomplish. This phase of the work continued until the mid-1980’s when one of us (A.C.) took a new position. Subsequently the class was no longer offered and from that point the work was continued sporadically as time allowed.</p><p>The study of paleocurrent structures has long provided useful information to sedimentologists and stratigraphers.

" href="/articles/sdata201525#ref16">16</a></sup>. For these and other reasons, a database of paleocurrent data can be a valuable resource for geologists working in a variety of disciplines.</p><p>Over time, we have continued to extract paleocurrent data from the literature. We developed a computer program to handle the data, and display it graphically. As our work continued, by the mid 1990s we had exhausted the readily available published records, but we found a new resource in geological theses and dissertations which often contained abundant data that were not published elsewhere. We changed our focus to this new source and began to acquire these data from universities around the world. Geology departments at nearly every major university in North America, in Australia, in England, in South America, and in Spain were visited and theses and dissertations were pulled and relevant parts were copied and later analysed for data. This work was carried out whenever it could be scheduled along with our other research projects. At present there are just over 1,000 references from bachelors, masters and doctoral theses in the database.</p><p>In the late 1990s and beyond, published papers with paleocurrent data began to be available on the internet. As a result, we were able to add extensive coverage of areas such as mainland China that have not been readily accessible until recently. A graduate student, Mingmin Wang joined our project in 2011 to help us read and interpret these papers. She continued to work with us on other areas as well. We have also begun to backfill from the published literature for the period extending back to the 1990s. It is our intent that this database will be supplemented with additional datasets over time. This is an ongoing work, but we felt that the database itself would be useful to other investigators in its present and growing form.</p><p>Data were acquired principally from North America during the initial phases of the study. With time, the study expanded into other areas of the world as it became apparent that paleocurrents patterns existed on the larger scales that Potter and Pettijohn had anticipated. The geographic and stratigraphic distributions of the datasets in the database are depicted in <a href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><b id="f1" class="block">Figure 1: Plot of the distribution of paleocurrent datasets by stratigraphic interval (abscissa) and geographic area (stacked bars).</b></figcaption><div class="box pt10 pr9 pb10 pl9 add-top-margin suppress-bottom-margin no-line-below"><div class="text13"><a href="/articles/sdata201525/figures/1"><img src="/article-assets/npg/sdata/2015/sdata201525/images_hires/m685/sdata201525-f1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" class="block"/></a><p>A total of 30,136 individual datasets are represented in the diagram.</p></div></div></figure><p>The great abundance of paleocurrent datasets (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) in the Proterozoic is a reflection of the greater abundance of clastic rocks found there compared with the overlying Paleozoic rocks. The decreased level of paleocurrent records for the post-Cambrian Palaeozoic likely results from the abundance of limestone at the expense of clastic rocks found there. Geologists rarely report paleocurrents from carbonate rocks, even though they are often derivable from those rocks<sup><a id="ref-link-section-17" title=" Hamblin, W. K. Marine paleocurrent directions in limestones of the Kansas City Group in eastern Kansas. Kansas Geol. Surv. Bull 194, 1–24 (1969). " href="/articles/sdata201525#ref17">17</a></sup>. The diminished coverage in epochs of the Cenozoic is in part (Paleocene, Oligocene), a reflection of the relative scarcity of these rocks in North America.</p><p>As presented here, the database contains 30,135 datasets representing over one million discrete paleocurrent determinations on outcrop (or in a few cases in well cores).
