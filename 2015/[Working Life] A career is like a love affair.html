                  <p id="p-1">I intended to become a researcher. Instead I became a science journalist, then an editor, and finally CEO of the American
                     Chemical Society (ACS) before I retired last year. At a recent event at Columbia University, hosted by the organization Women
                     in Science at Columbia, I told my career story and passed along lessons I've learned about how women can make the most of
                     their lives and careers. Here is some of the advice I offered at that event.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-2"><strong>Believe in yourself, and never take “no” for an answer.</strong> In graduate school, I loved reading <em>Chemical &amp; Engineering News</em> (<em>C&amp;EN</em>). So I thought to myself, “Why not get a job there?” I called Richard Kenyon, who was the publisher at the time, to ask for
                     an appointment. “Dr. Kenyon is busy all afternoon,” his secretary said. “I suggest you send a résumé.” Instead, I took a bus
                     to Kenyon's office. “Do you mind if I wait?” I asked the secretary. “You can wait, but he won't be able to see you,” she replied.
                  </p>
                  <div id="F1" class="fig pos-float nonresearch-content odd">
                     <div class="fig-inline"><a href="150/F1.expansion.html"><img alt="Figure" src="150/F1.small.gif"/></a>
                     </div>
                     <div class="fig-caption attrib">
                        
                        <p id="p-3" class="first-child">“Don't let others set the agenda.”</p>
                        <q class="attrib" id="attrib-1">ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER</q><p class="sb-div caption-clear"/>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <p id="p-4">When Kenyon got off the elevator, I raced over. You can imagine the look of horror on the secretary's face when he said, “Come
                     right in.”
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-5"><strong>Never burn bridges, but know when it's time to move on.</strong> I was the youngest staff member at <em>C&amp;EN</em> and the only woman. I loved working there. But when I discovered that my salary was 30% below a benchmark, I left. There
                     were no hard feelings; I just took a better job, at the National Institutes of Health, and then another, at the National Bureau
                     of Standards. I loved them both—and then I encountered the Boss From Hell.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-6"><strong>Take control.</strong> Instead of mentoring and supporting me, he stood over my shoulder micromanaging and yelling. I left as soon as I could but
                     not before learning a key lesson: Take control of your career. I encourage young women to construct 5-year plans focused on
                     their aspirations and how to achieve them. Don't let others set the agenda, and never, ever let yourself be bullied.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-7"><strong>Get a life.</strong> I landed at the Smithsonian Institution as chief science writer in the Office of Public Affairs. I stayed there 14 years.
                     It was a wonderful place to work, but it was all consuming: It was not unusual to get calls at 3 a.m. asking about a new panda
                     cub or a tornado at a storage facility. I sought a position where I could have a life outside of work. I returned to <em>C&amp;EN</em> and soon became editor-in-chief.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-8">It was a demanding job, but I was more in control of my time. When my beloved father became ill with lymphoma, I left work
                     every day at 5 p.m. to visit him, for 5 months. I cherish the time I spent with him. Barely a year after he died, I was diagnosed
                     with breast cancer. I didn't miss a day of work (except for the surgery), but I was grateful for the flexibility to fit it
                     all in. My cancer has been in remission for almost 18 years.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-9"><strong>A career is like a love affair.</strong> There are many parallels: Both have ups and downs, it can be hard to find the right one, and sometimes we don't choose wisely.
                     There might not be a single choice that gives satisfaction for a lifetime. To be worthwhile, relationships and careers must
                     be rich and rewarding and provide an environment in which we can grow and learn. I can't imagine staying in a relationship
                     that didn't have these qualities—and what else is a job except a relationship where you spend anywhere from 8 to 16 hours
                     a day?
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-10">So, relationship or job, how do you find the right one? There's a Cole Porter musical called <em>Nymph Errant</em>, about Evangeline, an adventurous young woman who aims to lose her virginity—pretty advanced stuff for 1933. In a song called
                     “Experiment,” Ms. Pratt, Evangeline's chemistry teacher, exhorts her: 
                     <q id="disp-quote-1">To do what all good scientists do / Experiment /… /Be curious /… / Get furious / At each attempt to hold you down. / If this
                        advice you always employ / The future can offer you infinite joy. /… / Experiment / And you'll see.</q>
                     
                     
                  </p><span class="highwire-journal-article-marker-end"/></div></div>
