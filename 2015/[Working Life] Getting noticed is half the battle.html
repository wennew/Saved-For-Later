                  <p id="p-1">The hiring game starts early. Well before a faculty position even opens, department members and administrators tend to observe
                     the available pool of candidates and shortlist the ones they consider most promising. Savvy candidates work this preselection
                     process to their advantage. Some ways of doing this are obvious: Be an excellent scholar. Publish well. Work hard. Communicate
                     with the public and your peers. But a well-planned, long-range effort to ensure your visibility among those who have hiring
                     responsibilities can be the deciding factor.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-2">Here's how it worked for me. I arrived at the University of Toronto in 1982 as a postdoctoral diploma candidate in clinical
                     biochemistry. Coming from a rather poor country—Greece—was a disadvantage, so I did all I could to adapt to the new environment,
                     fill in my knowledge gaps, and make a good impression with hard work and dedication. When I finished the diploma training
                     in 1984, the chair of the department showed interest in finding a job for me. But I had to go back to Greece first to complete
                     my medical degree. I finished it in 1986.

                  <p id="p-4">When I returned to Toronto, I was hired as the director of research and development at a small biotechnology company spun
                     off from the university; I also had an adjunct position in clinical biochemistry at the University of Toronto. I had no special
                     training or experience in business management, but I found myself directing eight Ph.D. scientists, working together to develop
                     a commercial product.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-5">Working at a company was not my first choice, but I gave it everything I had, and the work I did there laid a cornerstone
                     for my future success. I learned to appreciate the difficulties associated with developing and commercializing a system, which
                     we succeeded in doing toward the end of my time there. I learned how to manage people and how to keep them focused on a single
                     task. I met with potential customers and investors and learned how to negotiate and promote products and ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-6">The job was good and challenging, but it was not what I was aiming for in the long term. Meanwhile, a new chair had taken
                     over in the department, and I set out to persuade him to hire me as an academic clinician-scientist.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-7">I worked 16 to 17 hours a day, not just to make progress on the technology but also to publish our results in high-impact
                     journals. How did I manage it? My wife—also a Ph.D. scientist—worked far less than I did; she took on the bulk of the domestic
                     responsibilities. Our children spent many Saturdays and some Sundays playing in the company lobby. We made lunch in the break
                     room microwave.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-8">My colleagues and I managed to publish numerous papers, and I was invited repeatedly to present at national and international
                     conferences. I was able to demonstrate, in the department's annual report, scientific productivity comparable in quantity
                     and quality to the full-time academics in the department. I made sure these activities were noticed.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-9">I made myself visible by participating in every research seminar—not easy, considering the hour-long drive and how busy I
                     was at the company. Each time I entered the lecture room, I made a point of passing in front of the department chair before
                     sitting down. At the end of every seminar, I made sure to ask a carefully crafted question or two.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-10">After 18 months of this, the chair paid me an unexpected visit at the company and invited me to become his deputy in the department
                     and at the teaching hospital. Ten years later, I succeeded him.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-11">Our daughter, by the way, is now a Ph.D. scientist working as a clinical chemist, and our son is in training to become an
                     M.D.-Ph.D. neuropathologist. My wife is a senior scientist at a major teaching hospital.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-12">Making sure you are noticed can give you the edge you need over your silent competition.</p><span class="highwire-journal-article-marker-end"/></div></div>
