					<h2>Robustness of the multi-decadal bipolar seesaw after 1950</h2><p>To enhance credibility in our examination of interhemispheric or bipolar seesaw robustness, we employed two state-of-the-art compilations of SST data, including the Extended Reconstructed SST v3b<sup><a href="#ref7" title="Smith, T. M., Reynolds, R. W., Peterson, T. C. &amp; Lawrimore, J. Improvements to NOAA's historical merged land-ocean surface temperature analysis (1880-2006). J. Climate 21, 2283-2296 (2008)." id="ref-link-16">7</a></sup> (ERSSTV3b; no satellite data are used in this version) and the Hadley Centre Global SST (HadISST) data<sup><a href="#ref8" title="Rayner, N.

Because of the dramatically improved SST data quality after the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century (<a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Section II</a>), we focused on the latest time period of 1950–2009. The linear trends in annual mean global SSTs over the two sub-time periods of 1950–1979 and 1980–2009 highlight contrasting changes between the SH and NH (<a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f1">Fig. 1a–d</a>). During 1950–1979, the NH exhibited cooling and the SH warming; during 1980–2009, opposite changes occurred at high latitudes of both hemispheres, though broader warming extended into the SH due to a superimposed global-warming-forced long-term trend (hereafter we use the term “bipolar seesaw” to refer to this contrasting interhemispheric or bipolar surface temperature change).</p>

The NH mean surface temperature (<a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/">http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/</a>) is also well correlated with the SO SSTs with a lead of about 10 years (Correlation coefficients are −0.85 for HadSST3, −0.69 for ERSSTV3b, and −0.80 for HadISST, with the NH mean surface temperature leading the SO SSTs by 10 years, and their significance levels are less than 1%.). The lagged SO SST changes are presumably induced by deep convection at southern high latitudes.</p><p>While ref. <a href="#ref11" title="Schneider, D. P. &amp; Noone, D. C.

This robust feature offers an observational basis for the mechanism analysis below.</p><h2>Relationship between the SO SST variability and the Southern Annular Mode</h2><p>To explore atmospheric impacts upon the bipolar seesaw, we examined the relationship between SO SST variability and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM)<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Visbeck, M. A station-based southern annular mode index from 1884 to 2005. J. Climate. 22, 940-950 (2009)." id="ref-link-22">12</a></sup>, the leading atmospheric circulation mode over southern high latitudes. An increase (decrease) of the SAM index indicates a strengthening (weakening) and poleward (equatorward) shift in the SH westerly jet.</p><p>The long-term SAM index back to 1884 was derived by using mid-latitude and Antarctic station surface pressure data or by the concept of atmospheric mass conservation poleward of 20°S when Antarctic station data were not available before the Second World War (for details see ref. <a href="#ref12" title="Visbeck, M. A station-based southern annular mode index from 1884 to 2005. J. Climate. 22, 940-950 (2009)." id="ref-link-23">12</a>; this SAM index is consistent with other SAM index reconstructions, as demonstrated in <a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Section V and Fig. S5</a>). A regression analysis of annual mean SST on the SAM index<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Visbeck, M. A station-based southern annular mode index from 1884 to 2005. J. Climate. 22, 940-950 (2009)." id="ref-link-24">12</a></sup> shows a general cooling pattern over the SO, except for a slight warming around the Antarctic Peninsula and the Bellingshausen Sea (<a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>), corresponding to an increase in the SAM. This pattern is broadly consistent between the two SST datasets, though some regional differences exist, e.g., to the west of the Drake Passage, presumably due to sparse direct observational data in these regions and different approaches used to construct the gridded data sets. The roles of various physical processes associated with the strengthening of westerly winds, including Ekman drift, cloud reflection of shortwave radiation, and oceanic heat transports, in forcing the multi-decadal SO SST change have been examined (e.g., refs. <a href="#ref13" title="Hall, A. &amp; Visbeck.

	<h2>Driving role of NH and tropical thermal states in the SAM variability</h2><p>What mechanisms are responsible for the observed changes in SAM? Extensive studies have demonstrated that both Antarctic ozone depletion and global warming could have driven the strengthening of the SH westerly winds or the increasing SAM index since the 1970s (e.g., refs. <a href="#ref17" title="Thompson, D. W. J. &amp; Solomon, S. Interpretation of recent Southern Hemisphere climate change. Science 296, 895-899 (2002)." id="ref-link-33">17</a>,<a href="#ref18" title="Polvani, L. M., Waugh, D. J., Correa, G. J. P. &amp; Son, S.-W. Stratospheric ozone depletion: The main driver of twentieth-century atmospheric circulation changes in the Southern Hemisphere. J. Climate 24, 795-812 (2011)." id="ref-link-34">18</a>,<a href="#ref19" title="Kushner, P. J., Held, I. M. &amp; Delworth, T. L. Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation response to global warming. J. Climate 14, 2238-2249 (2001)." id="ref-link-35">19</a>, among others); in particular, Antarctic ozone depletion may have a much larger impact on the SH tropospheric circulation in summer than in other seasons through cooling the lower stratosphere<sup><a href="#ref18" title="Polvani, L. M., Waugh, D. J., Correa, G. J. P. &amp; Son, S.-W. Stratospheric ozone depletion: The main driver of twentieth-century atmospheric circulation changes in the Southern Hemisphere. J. Climate 24, 795-812 (2011)." id="ref-link-36">18</a></sup>. Because the first detectable Antarctic ozone decline occurred in the late 1970s<sup><a href="#ref20" title="Farman, J. C., Gardiner, B. G. &amp; Shanklin, J. D. Large losses of total ozone in Antarctica reveal seasonal ClOx/NOx interaction. Nature 315, 207-210 (1985)." id="ref-link-37">20</a></sup> and a large ozone hole began forming in 1982<sup><a href="#ref21" title="Stolarski, R. S. et al. Nimbus 7 satellite measurements of the springtime Antarctic ozone decrease. Nature 322, 808-811 (1986)." id="ref-link-38">21</a></sup>, we extended the study presented here to a longer period to examine how global mean temperature changes may impact SAM in the context of the bipolar patterns. Our study, therefore, includes the periods with both decreasing and increasing SAM phases and with and without an Antarctic ozone hole. Examining the relationship between SAM and global mean temperature over a period without an Antarctic ozone hole facilitates identifying the role of global temperature change in driving SAM variability.</p><p>Contributions to global mean temperature changes are strongly dependent on geographic regions. Due to much larger land cover and hence much larger surface temperature changes in the NH than in the SH, NH mean surface temperature change dominates global mean surface temperature change. Also, the averaged surface temperatures over the NH land mass and the North Atlantic, two relatively well-observed regions, are highly correlated with NH and hence global temperature changes. Therefore, to examine the impact of global atmospheric temperature change on SAM multi-decadal variability, we first used the surface temperature variability or change that occurred over the NH, the NH land mass<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Jones, P., New, M., Parker, D., Martin, S. &amp; Rigor, I. Surface air temperature and its variations over the last 150 years. Rev. Geophys. 37, 173-199 (1999)." id="ref-link-39">22</a></sup>, and the North Atlantic (over 0–70°N; average SST is used to define the AMO index after detrending).</p><p>SAM, NH mean surface temperature, NH land SAT, and North Atlantic SSTs demonstrate coherent multi-decadal variability, especially after 1930 (<a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). A close examination of <a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a> indicates that the multi-decadal SAM variability corresponds well to major NH surface temperature fluctuations. The correlation coefficients between the SAM index and the AMO indices, averaged SAT over the NH land mass, and NH mean surface temperature after 1950 are 0.76 for HadSST3, 0.79 for ERSSTV3b, 0.50 for HadISST, 0.88 for the averaged SAT over the NH land mass, and 0.93 for the NH mean surface temperature; significance levels were determined to be less than 1% (these strong correlations are robust, as also supported by other available SAM and NH land SAT reconstructions, see <a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. S5</a>). Mechanisms responsible for NH multi-decadal SST and SAT variability have been extensively studied recently. Though the AMOC change<sup><a href="#ref4" title="Delworth, T. L. &amp; Zeng, F.

	<p>Theoretical and modelling studies have shown that surface cooling or warming in the tropical region can lead to amplified air temperature changes in the upper tropical troposphere<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Santer, B. D. et al. Amplification of surface temperature trends and variability in the tropical atmosphere. Science 309, 1551-1556 (2005)." id="ref-link-46">28</a></sup>, which can significantly alter the equator-to-pole temperature gradient in the upper troposphere and hence can strongly affect the SAM<sup><a href="#ref19" title="Kushner, P. J., Held, I. M. &amp; Delworth, T. L. Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation response to global warming. J. Climate 14, 2238-2249 (2001)." id="ref-link-47">19</a></sup>. This motivated us to examine the relationship between the SAM variability and the tropical SST variability. We found that SAM index decreasing (increasing) generally corresponds to tropical surface cooling (warming) during the course of their multidecadal fluctuations after around 1940 (<a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f3">Fig. 3b</a>), though some differences in fluctuation amplitudes and shorter time scale variability appear across the three datasets. In particular as shown in HadSST3, a recently updated SST dataset that has more realistic tropical SST variability<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Tokinaga, H., Xie, S.-P., Deser, C., Kosaka, Y. &amp; Okumura, Y. M. Slowdown of the Walker circulation driven by tropical Indo-Pacific warming. Nature 491, 439-444 (2012)." id="ref-link-48">29</a></sup>, the overall cooling trend between the 1940s and 1970s corresponds to the decreasing SAM index over the same period. The correlation coefficient between the SAM index and the detrended HadSST3 tropical surface temperature after 1950 is 0.93, and the correlation coefficient between the detrended HadSST3 tropical surface temperature and the detrended SO SST is 0.81 when the former leads the latter by 10 years; their significance levels were determined to be less than 1% using the non-parametric random phase method<sup><a href="#ref10" title="Ebisuzaki, W. A method to estimate the statistical significance of a correlation when the data are serially correlated. J. Climate 10, 2417-2153 (1997)." id="ref-link-49">10</a></sup>.</p><p>To further elucidate how NH and tropical surface temperature changes can drive the SAM variability, we analysed vertical structures of global air temperature changes. The air temperature change analysis was conducted by using the atmospheric reanalysis datasets. After an evaluation of derived temperature trends from these datasets (for details see <a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Section VI</a>), we elected to use the atmospheric reanalysis data, ERA-40<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Uppala, S. M. et al. The ERA-40 reanalysis. Quart. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc. 131, 2961-3012 (2005)." id="ref-link-50">30</a></sup>, for illustrating the involved mechanisms for the following reasons. First, the temperature trends in the tropical troposphere derived from this particular reanalysis are consistent with the observed tropical surface temperature changes, as determined by the basic nature of physics<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Santer, B. D. et al. Amplification of surface temperature trends and variability in the tropical atmosphere. Science 309, 1551-1556 (2005)." id="ref-link-51">28</a></sup>. Second, ERA-40 data are available from September 1957 to August 2002, covering a cooling period (before roughly 1970) and then a warming period, permitting analysis of concurrent changes in global temperatures at different levels of the atmosphere for the periods with opposite surface temperature changes. Below, we highlight those temperature changes that are consistent with surface temperature changes and relevant to multi-decadal SAM variability.</p><p>Significant, broad NH cooling is found within the zonal mean temperature of the lower troposphere and near the surface during 1958–71 (a surface cooling period in the tropical region) (<a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>), indicating an upward extension of the NH land SAT and SST changes shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>. In the middle troposphere cooling becomes larger and broader, while in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere changes are characterized by cooling at lower latitudes and relatively less cooling or even warming at high latitudes. Broad SH warming extends from the lower stratosphere to the surface, with warming much weaker at the surface. Overall, the most notable changes in atmospheric temperature during this period are surface cooling in the NH and tropics and amplified cooling in the tropical upper troposphere. This changed temperature pattern reduces the SH equator-to-pole temperature gradient in the lower stratosphere and the upper troposphere.</p>

	<p>Between 1979 and 2001 (more reanalysis datasets have been developed for this satellite era since 1979, hence permitting an evaluation of consistency among these datasets for this particular period; see <a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Section VI</a> for details), there was broad NH warming from the surface to the upper atmosphere, except for in the lower stratosphere, where cooling occurred (<a href="/srep/2015/150310/srep08909/full/srep08909.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). We highlight in particular two important features from the tropics to the SH middle and high latitudes: i) relatively large warming occurred, mainly in the middle troposphere at middle and high latitudes, and ii) significant cooling was exhibited above 350 hPa at the SH high latitudes, and a contrasting significant warming emerged in the tropical upper troposphere around 200 hPa.</p><p>This first feature suggests an increased static stability in SH mid-latitudes, which could push the eddy-driven jet poleward and strengthen westerly winds<sup><a href="#ref31" title="Frierson, D.
