		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Time-series observations are critical to understanding the structure, function, and dynamics of marine ecosystems. The Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program has maintained near-monthly sampling at Station ALOHA (22° 45′N, 158° 00′W) in the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) since 1988 and identified ecosystem variability over seasonal to interannual time-scales. To further extend the temporal resolution of these near-monthly time-series observations, an extensive field campaign was conducted during July-September 2012 at Station ALOHA with near-daily sampling of upper water-column biogeochemistry, phytoplankton abundance, and activity. The resulting dataset provides biogeochemical measurements at high temporal resolution and documented two important events at Station ALOHA: (1) a prolonged period of low productivity when net community production in the mixed layer shifted to a net heterotrophic state and (2) detection of a distinct sea-surface salinity minimum feature which was prominent in the upper water-column (0–50 m) for a period of approximately 30 days. The shipboard observations during July-September 2012 were supplemented with <em>in situ</em> measurements provided by Seagliders, profiling floats, and remote satellite observations that together revealed the extent of the low productivity and the sea-surface salinity minimum feature in the NPSG.</p></div>
