					<p>The present study investigated trends in coastal upwelling for coastal regions of the world using the CFSR wind database with high spatial resolution (approximately 0.3°). This database facilitates the analysis of wind behaviour at a small scale, which is a key factor when considering coastal mesoscale effects as upwelling. Recent studies have compared this database and different wind products with wind measured by several buoys along the Iberian Peninsula coast<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Alvarez, I., Gómez-Gesteira, M., deCastro, M., Carvalho, D.

Statistical results confirmed that datasets with finer spatial resolution, such as CFSR, gave better results, especially near the coast.</p><p>In this study, 3025 coastal points worldwide were analysed to select the major upwelling regions and evaluate upwelling trends from 1982 to 2010. Under our terms of selection, ten upwelling systems were evaluated: Benguela, Canary, the southern Caribbean Sea, Chile, Peru, California (north and south), West Australia, Java, North Kenya, and Somalia–Oman. These systems were grouped together into several macroscopic zones, namely the eastern and western coasts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. No upwelling systems along the western Pacific Ocean were assessed. Alongshore wind stress was calculated over more than 600 points along this coast, and no region fulfilled the conditions required to be considered a coastal upwelling area.</p><h2>Eastern Atlantic Ocean</h2><p>Two upwelling systems were analysed along this coast from south to north: Benguela (South 30.13–23.26°S; North 20.76–16.39°S) and Canary (18.89–32.63°N) (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Along the Benguela upwelling system, which is one of the major upwelling regions of the world, two different areas (south and north) were assessed based on the results of the calculated alongshore wind stress (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Previous studies were focused mainly on the southern area from the southern tip of Africa to about 20°S. Nevertheless, several studies evaluated the entire area from south of 15°S. The results of the present study for the southern and northern areas will be described below, and then a comparison with results from previous studies will be presented.</p>

	<h2>Benguela</h2><p>At the southern coast of the Benguela system, alongshore wind stress had positive values (upwelling-favourable conditions) throughout the year, but the highest values occurred during the austral spring and summer months (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>, points 16–38). The upwelling season was defined as September to March based on the annual cycle of alongshore wind stress meridionally averaged over these points.

Non-significant trends were identified south of 24 °S, and only the three northernmost grid boxes (–23.3 to 24°S) displayed a significant positive trend. These significant positive trends continued throughout the Northern Benguela Zone (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>), although the defined upwelling season differed for this zone (from July to November).

Trends in upwelling can be highly dependent on the length of the time series, the selected area, and the season evaluated in the analysis.

 trends were calculated for these months (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#f6">Fig. 6a</a>). Significant negative trends were observed south of 34 °S and north of 31 °S, with values between –4 10<sup>−3</sup> and –8 10<sup>−3</sup> Nm<sup>–2</sup> dec<sup>–1</sup>. Non-significant positive trends were detected at midlatitudes. Previous studies along this coast have reported different results. For example, Garreaud and Falvey<sup><a href="#ref26" title="Garreaud, R. D., Falvey, M. The coastal winds off western subtropical South America in future climate scenarios. Int. J. Climatol., 29, 543–554 (2009)." id="ref-link-43">26</a></sup> analysed changes in the coastal winds along the west coast of subtropical South America (20–55°S; 70–85°W) using future climate scenarios. Different simulations were performed using the Providing REgional Climate for Impact Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model, and a significant trend in the coastal wind was absent during the late twentieth century (1961–1990). Similar results were observed by Goubanova <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref27" title="Goubanova, K., et al.

Points located along the Chile coast (30 and 36.4°S) showed unclear trend over the last 30 years. Finally, Aravena <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref29" title="Aravena, G., Broitman, B., Stenseth, N. C.

 trends were calculated over these months (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#f8">Fig. 8a</a>). Positive trends were detected for almost the whole region, with significant values between 4-8 10<sup>−3</sup> Nm<sup>–2</sup> dec<sup>–1</sup> south of 25.5°S. Non-significant negative trends were found at the northernmost latitudes (21.4–22.9°S). As far as we know, no studies regarding upwelling trends in terms of wind have been conducted along the western coast of Australia. Previous studies have shown the absence of persistent upwelling off this coast despite a prevailing summer wind system favouring upwelling. This absence of upwelling has been attributed to the presence of the Leewin Current (LC), a warm poleward flow transporting nutrient-poor waters from the tropics<sup><a href="#ref37" title="Church, J. A., Cresswell, G., Godfrey, J. S. The Leeuwin Current. In: Neshyba S.J., Mooers Ch. N. K., Smith R.L., Barber R.T., editors . Poleward flow along eastern ocean boundaries. Coast. Estuar. Stud. 34.

Unlike other eastern boundary currents (e.g., the Benguela and Humboldt Currents at similar latitudes), the poleward flow of the LC suppresses the persistent upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich, subsurface water onto the western Australia continental shelf<sup><a href="#ref39" title="Pearce, A.

Significant negative trends were detected for the entire region, with values of around –2 10<sup>−3</sup> Nm<sup>–2</sup> dec<sup>–1</sup>. The coast of northern Kenya is characterized by the occurrence of an irregular upwelling linked to the northeast monsoon, which normally develops from November to March. Several researchers have related the occurrence of this upwelling to higher productivity in the area, although the fact that upwelling events are not regular has attracted relatively little scientific interest about upwelling trends in terms of wind. This region has been studied mainly in terms of changes in chemical and biological oceanographic parameters related to the occurrence of the northeast and southeast monsoons, which lead to important differences between the Kenya and Somalia coasts in terms of upwelling<sup><a href="#ref54" title="McClanahan, T.

Upwelling is induced by an alongshore current driven by the southwest monsoon in summer.

In contrast, using the same database and an advanced coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, Izumo <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref67" title="Izumo, T., et al. The role of the western Arabian Sea upwelling in Indian monsoon rainfall variability, J. Clim., 21, 5603–5623 (2008)." id="ref-link-104">67</a></sup> detected a decrease in upwelling from 1979 to 2006 caused by anomalously weak southwesterly winds in late spring over the Arabian Sea. More recently, Piontkovski <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref68" title="Piontkovski, S. A., AL-Gheilani, H. M. H., Jupp, B. P., Al-Azri, A. R., Al-Hashmi, K. A. Interannual changes in the Sea of Oman ecosystem. Open Mar. Biol. J. 6, 38–52 (2012)." id="ref-link-105">68</a></sup> described a declining trend in the zonal component of wind speed over the Sea of Oman (22–25°N) during summer monsoons from the late 1950s to 2010.</p><p>Results obtained for different upwelling systems around the world illustrate that it is not possible to describe a homogenous behaviour among them because trends change substantially, even in regions with similar oceanographic processes. Of the five major upwelling regions worldwide, increasing trends in upwelling were observed in the coastal areas of Benguela, Peru, Canary, and northern California, and the increases were statistically significant only for the two last systems. A general decrease in upwelling intensity was observed along the Chile, southern and central California, and central Somalia coasts, with significant values in all regions. Thus, no evidence for a general intensification of upwelling along these systems was observed.</p><p>The general trends found in our study were similar to those reported in studies in which wind stress data were used (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#t1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#t2">2</a>). It is important to note that controversial results were also obtained by different authors using the same variable and even the same period of time<sup><a href="#ref2" title="Barton, E. D., Field, D.

		<p>Different trends were also detected along the less studied upwelling regions. For example, significant decreasing trends were observed along the coast of Java and northern Kenya, whereas a tendency to an increase in upwelling-favourable winds was detected in western Australia. In the southern Caribbean upwelling region, a significant negative (positive) trend was found east (west) of 71.25°W.</p><p>Our analysis covered the last three decades (1982–2010), which is the recent period of strongest global warming, thus it allowed detailed analysis of the influence of warming processes on upwelling trends. In another study, Lima and Wethey<sup><a href="#ref69" title="Lima, F. P., Wethey, D. S. Three decades of high-resolution coastal sea surface temperatures reveal more than warming. Nature Commun. 3, 704 (2012)." id="ref-link-108">69</a></sup> estimated changes in coastal SST by exploring monthly warming patterns along the world’s coastline at a scale of 0.25° for the period 1982–2010. They found that even though most coastal areas worldwide have been warming, the magnitude of change has been highly heterogeneous in both space and season. They described a coastal SST decrease nearly year-round in the areas influenced by the California and Humboldt currents, which could be related to a tendency for intensification of upwelling following Bakun’s hypothesis. Nevertheless, our results revealed an increasing trend in upwelling along the northern California (38–42°N) and Peru coasts and negative trends along the Chile and southern-central California coasts (<a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#t2">Table 2</a>). On the other hand, Lima and Wethey<sup><a href="#ref69" title="Lima, F. P., Wethey, D. S. Three decades of high-resolution coastal sea surface temperatures reveal more than warming. Nature Commun. 3, 704 (2012)." id="ref-link-109">69</a></sup> found a general SST increase in the areas of the Canary, Benguela, and Somali currents, which could indicate a decrease of upwelled, cooler waters linked to an upwelling reduction. Our results only revealed a decrease in upwelling-favourable winds along the Somalia coast.</p><p>Among the upwelling systems analysed in the present study, Lima and Wethey<sup><a href="#ref69" title="Lima, F. P., Wethey, D. S. Three decades of high-resolution coastal sea surface temperatures reveal more than warming. Nature Commun. 3, 704 (2012)." id="ref-link-110">69</a></sup> found that coastal temperatures have been warming almost homogeneously throughout the year along the southern Caribbean upwelling region and along the Java and northern Kenya coasts. The western Australia coast has become colder from January to September. These results can be linked to the upwelling trends found in the present work. We detected decreasing trends in upwelling along the southern Caribbean, Java, and northern Kenya coasts, whereas a general upward trend was found along the western Australia coast.</p><p>These results delve into a possible discussion about whether the Bakun hypothesis is being fulfilled or not taking into account the present study and those mentioned in <a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#t1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="/srep/2015/150508/srep10016/full/srep10016.html#t2">2</a>. Even in regions where previously not many studies regarding upwelling trends existed, like the Java coast or the southern Caribbean upwelling region, different behaviours can be observed contradicting the general upward trend predicted by Bakun due to global warning.</p>
