The small size of ice samples used in this study prevented the use of techniques that remove several cm of core, and so we developed a technique using Kyocera ceramic blades that sequentially removed contaminated ice-core material. Each piece of ice was placed on a PTFE board and held with a clean PE glove, while the outside few mm were scraped off with a clean ceramic blade. This was repeated three times using separate clean equipment. To achieve the lowest contamination levels, all ice sampling equipment and ice were only handled with clean PE gloves, and all ice decontamination was carried out under Class 100 laminar flow air within the cold room (−20<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>°C) at the British Antarctic Survey.</p><p>Decontamination blanks were 47<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>pg<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>g<sup>−1</sup> for Fe and 116<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>pg<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>g<sup>−1</sup> for Al (&lt;0.1<span class="mb">%</span> of natural conc.), and testing established that using acid-cleaned equipment had no effect on the natural pH of ice (pH ~5.3).

In the present study, we were motivated to develop a sublimation technique to extract dust from ice cores without exposing the dust to liquid water at a pH lower than that of seawater (pH ~8), which may alter the speciation or solubility of Fe within dust before analysis (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150723/ncomms8850/full/ncomms8850.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Discussion</a>).

To allow flexibility depending on the mass of dust/ice required by experiments, two configurations of the system were designed (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150723/ncomms8850/full/ncomms8850.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). In the present study, ice samples were placed directly on membranes within filter rigs within a Savillex PFA Teflon Jar with top ports open (25–50<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>g; <a href="/ncomms/2015/150723/ncomms8850/full/ncomms8850.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 3a</a>). A second configuration, not used in the present study, allows for the collection of large dust masses, with larger pieces of ice (&gt;50<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>g) placed within 1<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>l bottles within a 4-l bottle with holes drilled in the lid (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150723/ncomms8850/full/ncomms8850.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 3b</a>). Although ice sublimes under any pressures and temperatures below the triple point, previous studies have shown that quasi- and surface-melting can occur on ice or ice–glass surfaces at temperatures (−1 to −4<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>°C) and pressures below the triple point<sup><a href="#ref60" title="Elbaum, M., Lipson, S.

To avoid this, it is necessary to keep the ice cold until the pressure is sufficiently lowered, and to operate at pressures much lower than the triple point (&lt;2<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>mbar). To achieve this, first the glass desiccator was taken into a Class 100 laminar flow bench within the cold room and allowed to cool before being cleaned with propanol. Jars or bottles were then placed within the cleaned desiccator and the desiccator was closed and sealed before being transferred to the warm laboratory and connected to the pumps. This ensured that samples remained clean and that the ice remained cold for ~10<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>min while the pressure was reduced below the triple point to the typical running pressure of 0.8–1.6<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>mbar.</p><p>Sublimation was allowed to proceed until all ice was gone, which was assessed visually or when the pressure had dropped to the background of the empty chamber (0.26<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>mbar). Rates of sublimation were relatively slow, dependent on ice mass and volume, with a maximum rate of ~250<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>g per 24<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>h. Small samples (5–10<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>g) sublimed in several hours, but were typically left overnight to ensure all ice was gone.</p><p>Once all ice had sublimed, the desiccator was sealed, disconnected and returned to the laminar flow bench to slowly allow clean air to enter the chamber; this prevented both dust being blown away by a sudden increase in pressure and the entry of dirty air from the pump. The bottles containing the dry dust samples were then carefully bagged and taken for ‘seawater-leaching’ procedures (see next section). Blank contamination for the whole procedure over 24 hours was found to be acceptably low (~40 pg Fe per ice sample).</p><h2>Seawater-leaching procedures and Fe analysis</h2><p>Ice samples for seawater-soluble Fe analysis (‘seawater-leaching’) were placed on a membrane on a PFA rig within a 1 l PFA jar within a glass desiccator at −20<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>°C, and quickly placed cleanly under vacuum (before moisture could form) at ~18<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>°C.
