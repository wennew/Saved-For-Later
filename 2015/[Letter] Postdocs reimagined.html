                  <p id="p-1">In April, we asked young scientists if the idea of the postdoc position is obsolete. If so, what should replace it, and if
                     not, how can it be improved? We received a record response of more than 300 submissions. About a third of respondents felt
                     that postdocs are indeed obsolete. The rest deemed them necessary, if imperfect. Many felt that creating a permanent staff
                     scientist position, with full salary and benefits, would help the plight of postdocs, either by replacing the postdoc entirely
                     or by serving as a long-term option after the completion of a postdoc. Others suggested that a system in which postdocs had
                     dedicated funding and were not beholden to a PI would foster more creativity and minimize exploitation. Tailoring postdocs
                     to a broader array of career paths was another common theme. Many responses reflected the feeling that postdocs deserve more
                     respect and recognition. A sample of the responses describing these and other ideas can be found below. To allow for as many
                     voices as possible, in some cases we have printed excerpts of longer submissions (indicated by ellipses) and lightly copyedited
                     original text for clarity. To read the complete versions, as well as many more, go to <a href="http://scim.ag/NG15R">http://scim.ag/NG15R</a>. Follow <em>Science</em>'s NextGen VOICES survey on Twitter with the hashtag #NextGenSci.

                  <p id="p-7">Postdoctoral scientists are far from being obsolete; rather, they are the drivers of research. They made it through a Kryptonian
                     Ph.D. thesis and emerged ever-more-powerful and fearless to continue in science. They act as mentors and as students. They
                     constitute the chain link between the “drowning under grant deadlines, conference talks, endless responsibilities,” stressed-out
                     professor, and the “desperate to finally finish his Ph.D. and get out of here” stressed-out Ph.D. student. They think of projects,
                     perform experiments, analyze data, and write papers. They generate beautiful hypotheses, as well as the ugly data that annihilate
                     these same hypotheses…. They stand in a limbo state: They have already committed themselves to science, but the science world
                     has not committed to them….

                  <p id="p-10">There should be no postdoc positions. Recent graduates should be able to compete directly for full-time research and faculty
                     positions. It's absurd to expect an individual with a Ph.D. to work into their mid- to late 30s without full employment benefits
                     at income levels that are often well below the median levels for their area. The current system does not offer fair compensation
                     at precisely the time that one needs to start and support a family. The average number of years spent working as a postdoc
                     is 5; the average number of years spent at any job in the United States is also 5. Why is the postdoc neither fully compensated
                     nor fully employed?

                     Ph.D.s were rare and conferred expertise, recognition, and prestige. This is no longer the case. The Ph.D. system…should be
                     replaced with a system that allows researchers with Bachelor's or Master's degrees to be free agents in host… (academic or
                     corporate) labs until they are ready to apply for faculty positions…. The free-agent system would be more dynamic and eliminate
                     the postdoc problem. It would also force academic research to be more competitive in terms of pay, conditions, and personal
                     development.

                  <p id="p-16">The goal of any academic career track after the Ph.D. should be to prepare a researcher for a leadership research position….
                     Currently, postdocs apply for positions in the labs of tenured PIs, where their primary work includes pursuing research topics
                     assigned to them by their superior, managing students, preparing project proposals, and applying for grants within the PI's
                     field…To facilitate more independence in postdocs,…these postdoc positions should be financed directly from the government
                     or university, and not through PIs.…This would allow for the postdocs to (i) at least partially pursue their own scientific
                     questions, (ii) try working under more than a single PI and therefore experience different managerial practices, and (iii)
                     see whether independent research suits them. The last is especially important, because setting your own scientific goals is
                     much more difficult than following someone else's.

                     and university funds to lead a small group of jointly supervised graduate students who are interested in the proposal topic.
                     Applying for external funding and being fully responsible for a small lab model would not only help the postdoc to mature
                     for his next career step as an assistant professor, but would stimulate new avenues of research for graduate students.

                     cheap labor force. From the point of view of a postdoc, it's the most challenging time in trying to build a base for one's
                     interests, publish, and most important, be able to walk that tightrope of what can be taken with them and what the PI would
                     like to retain in the lab.… To give the postdoc more autonomy, I would strongly recommend that there be more funding opportunities
                     that allow for postdocs to be more in charge of their projects and what they would like to pursue. This also serves as training
                     to be able to manage money and plan experiments according to a fixed budget.

                     A grant-giving institution would then limit the number of postdocs with each goal according to market demand (for example,
                     50% for the industry goal, 30% for the team lead goal, and 20% for the teacher goal). At the end of the postdoc period, the
                     success should be evaluated and if the goal was not reached, consequences should follow; the university should have to pay
                     the past postdoc salary from its own money, or future grant money should be reduced.

                  <p id="p-40">With an increasing number of Ph.D. graduates aiming to pursue nonacademic career tracks, there is an urgent need to revamp
                     the traditional postdoc position, the majority of which do not prepare graduates for jobs outside academia. A systemic integration
                     of career support into Ph.D. programs in all universities is critical to ensure that maximum returns are channeled from the
                     national investment in graduate education. An experiential 1-year career-rotation program (not unlike first-year lab rotations)
                     should follow graduation. Ph.D. graduates would have the opportunity to pursue three to four internships in different settings
                     that value a terminal degree in their field of study. Examples of organizations for which the graduates might intern include
                     science societies, policy think-tanks, law firms, regulatory affairs teams, nonprofit organizations, government agencies,
                     and biotech start-ups. The graduates could be placed in these internships through a matching process facilitated by the university
                     and funded by stakeholders in the process. Such a transition program would be transformative for the educational ecosystem
                     because it would help students identify and gain a foothold in the career track of their choice, allow employers access to
                     a pool of highly qualified job candidates, and help participating universities bolster their student success metrics.

                     then I think the postdoc is obsolete. I would make two changes to improve it: (i) Make postdocs into permanent, nonfaculty
                     positions. Both individuals and institutions would benefit. A scientist who has to reapply for his/her job every 2 to 3 years—especially
                     if that means moving to a new institution—has much less time to develop expertise.…(ii) Remove the stigma associated with
                     the postdoc—i.e., the idea that if you postdoc for more than 3 years, you must not be faculty material…. Why treat postdocs
                     like lepers if they take more than 3 years to discover something exciting enough to rocket them into a faculty position?

                     has accidentally evolved into a pyramid structure, where the vast majority of postdocs cannot expect to find long-term sustainable

                     research scientists should be held accountable for the progress of their research, the labs in which they work should be run
                     with more oversight. Lead investigators should receive managerial training, and an overarching university body should evaluate
                     the management of labs to ensure that research scientists receive appropriate guidance and regular feedback. Within labs,
                     a substructure of collaborative research groups could provide new hires with direct supervision and would also provide senior
                     lab members with the opportunity to develop managerial skills needed for their future success as lead investigators. However,
                     each research scientist need not aim to run an independent lab, as one could rise to a senior research scientist or director
                     level position within a lab, so long as he/she continues to be productive in his/her own research and contributes to the development
                     of others in the lab. A key strength of this structure is that it values contribution to the overall success of the group
                     rather than solely rewarding individual accomplishments.

                  <p id="p-70">I think the problems facing research make the postdoc position more important, not obsolete…. I suspect that a good number
                     of fresh ideas in research would not have come about if there were one less step between the lab bench and grant writing…Perhaps
                     there should be grant mechanisms for grad students funding a short postdoc, with the stipulation that it must be a complete
                     departure from what the student worked on in grad school.

                  <p id="p-73">…The increasing rarity of tenure-track positions means that postdocs need to be prepared for jobs that are significantly less
                     attractive. One must honestly answer the question “What am I willing to give up for a career in academia?” before proceeding
                     toward a postdoc.
