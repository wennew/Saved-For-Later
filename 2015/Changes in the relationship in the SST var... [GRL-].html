		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>It is found that sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the central-to-eastern tropical Pacific has a strong negative correlation with that of the central-to-eastern North Pacific during the 1998/99 regime shift in the boreal winter. This phenomenon is in contrast to before the 1998/99 regime shift. The anomalous Aleutian low pressure associated with the tropical SST forcing becomes stronger and its center shifted to the south and to the west after 1998/99. Concurrently, such a modulation causes the North Pacific SST to effectively change. This results in a close relationship between the tropical Pacific-North Pacific SST variability. The modulation of the Aleutian low pressure is primarily due to the location of the tropical convective heating, which shifted to the west around the dateline during 1998/99. The results of simple atmospheric model experiments support this hypothesis that the shift in the tropical convective heating to the west is responsible for the modulation of the Aleutian low pressure, leading to the change in the relationship with the tropical Pacific-North Pacific SST variability. These results imply that the predictability of the North Pacific SST after 1998/99 is enhanced due to the high correlation with the tropical Pacific SST variability.</p></div>
