It's the average sea level pressure that really stands out, though. Except for 2011 no year comes close to the intensity and size of the high pressure area covering Greenland and almost all of the Arctic Ocean. This means that the relatively high temperatures were accompanied by a solar bombardment in those areas where ice is supposed to be thickest.</p>\n<p>And this trend continues during the second half of July:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7beee86970b-pi\"><img title=\"SAT-SLP comparison July 16-31\" alt=\"SAT-SLP comparison July 16-31\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7beee86970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>SLP is unequalled in this comparison.

And again, also during this second half of July, temperatures have been anomalously high in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago where a lot of the thickest, oldest ice is situated.</p>\n<p>Speaking of PIOMAS volume, just today Wipneus <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,119.msg60637.html#msg60637\">posted</a> this animation on the Forum showing how volume loss proceeded during July:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf9155970b-pi\"><img title=\"PIOMAS July\" alt=\"PIOMAS July\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf9155970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>With that much heat and open skies, compactness will invariably take a dive. Remember:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Compactness is calculated by dividing sea ice area numbers with sea ice extent numbers, which gives us a percentage. Short explanation: the Arctic is divided into grid cells. When 15% or more of a grid cell is covered with sea ice it will be counted as 100% covered with ice for extent (meaning the total km2 of the grid cell will be counted for total sea ice extent), whereas the exact amount of km2 that is covered with sea ice will be counted for area. This means that area will always be lower than extent, because of leads or open water within the grid cell.</p>\n<p>Here's the thing: melt ponds fool the satellite sensors into thinking that there is open water where there is none. This will get counted for area, but not for extent (unless a melt pond is so big that the 15% threshold is passed). So, if there are a lot of melt ponds, area will go down faster than extent, and the percentage will drop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's the CAPIE graph, wherein I divide Cryopshere Today sea ice area numbers by JAXA (formerly IJIS) sea ice extent numbers:<a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf9380970b-pi\"><img title=\"CAPIE20150813\" alt=\"CAPIE20150813\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf9380970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>At the end of July this year's trend line was the second lowest on record, indicating lots of dispersal and melt ponding. But as a matter of fact, Wipneus' compactness graph, using better, more compatible data shows that this year has been lowest - and still is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf93f3970b-pi\"><img title=\"Amsr2-compact-compare\" alt=\"Amsr2-compact-compare\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf93f3970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a>And with this we return to the latest melt pond distribution maps that were yet again sent to me by David Schröder from the University of Reading, and are based on his research published <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/more-on-melt-ponds.html\">last year</a>. Mind you, these maps are model results and don't display the exact locations of melt ponds, but give an idea of how this year compares to record smashing 2012 (left) and rebound year 2014 (middle):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf949e970b-pi\"><img title=\"Melt ponds Schroeder July\" alt=\"Melt ponds Schroeder July\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf949e970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>It's clear that according to the model this year has a higher melt pond cover fraction than last year, but 2012 is in a league of its own. Combine this with the compactness numbers, and one might conclude that the low percentage has more to do with ice pack dispersal than melt ponding. This could be correct, as an enormous part of the sea ice pack on the Pacific side of the Arctic has been shred apart in the past few weeks (more on that in a forthcoming article later this weekend).</p>\n<p>And so, to return to the introduction of this article, May and June are very important for determining the range of possibilities of an individual melting season. But July can still pull away one block too many, and the whole edifice comes tumbling down, just like in the game of Jenga. This year it won't tumble down as hard as 2012 did, because of the influence the 2014 rebound year has had on the initial sea ice state (see the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/20142015-winter-analysis.html\">2014/2015 Winter analysis</a>) and the lack of preconditioning during May and June, but it will be interesting to see how far this late melting momentum and compaction potential can take the 2015 melting season. It will be difficult to match 2007 and 2011, but it's not entirely impossible either. And then there's the knock-on consequences for volume and multi-year ice.</p>\n<p>Either way, July has shown what can happen when temps and sea level pressure are high. Chances of such a July happening is getting greater every year in a warming world (see <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://robertscribbler.com/2015/08/14/2015s-cruel-climate-count-continues-as-nasa-shows-july-was-hottest-on-record/\">this article</a> by Robertscribbler to see how heat records are currently being smashed around the world, and what the consequences are). There will come a year where the initial sea ice state is worse than this year, followed by above average preconditioning. Then add a July such as this one, and you have a recipe for near ice-free conditions come September. To think that this process is not going to affect anything or anyone, is even worse than not thinking at all.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>I'd like to thank David Schröder and all his co-authors for taking the time and effort to provide me with their model results. It has been a huge help in assessing the direction this melting season has been taking.</p></div>","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1439591343000,"title":"Jenga July 2015","published":1439591343000,"crawled":1439592188140,"alternate":[{"href":"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/jenga-july-2015.html","type":"text/html"}],"author":"Neven","origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/atom.xml","title":"Arctic Sea Ice","htmlUrl":"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/"},"summary":{"content":"And thus the tradition of the ASIB alliteration of months continues.

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf949e970b-pi"><img alt="Melt ponds Schroeder July" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf949e970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7bf949e970b-800wi" title="Melt ponds Schroeder July"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>It's clear that according to the model this year has a higher melt pond cover fraction than last year, but 2012 is in a league of its own. Combine this with the compactness numbers, and one might conclude that the low percentage has more to do with ice pack dispersal than melt ponding. This could be correct, as an enormous part of the sea ice pack on the Pacific side of the Arctic has been shred apart in the past few weeks (more on that in a forthcoming article later this weekend).</p>&#13;
<p>And so, to return to the introduction of this article, May and June are very important for determining the range of possibilities of an individual melting season. But July can still pull away one block too many, and the whole edifice comes tumbling down, just like in the game of Jenga. This year it won't tumble down as hard as 2012 did, because of the influence the 2014 rebound year has had on the initial sea ice state (see the <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/20142015-winter-analysis.html" target="_self">2014/2015 Winter analysis</a>) and the lack of preconditioning during May and June, but it will be interesting to see how far this late melting momentum and compaction potential can take the 2015 melting season. It will be difficult to match 2007 and 2011, but it's not entirely impossible either. And then there's the knock-on consequences for volume and multi-year ice.</p>&#13;
<p>Either way, July has shown what can happen when temps and sea level pressure are high. Chances of such a July happening is getting greater every year in a warming world (see <a href="http://robertscribbler.com/2015/08/14/2015s-cruel-climate-count-continues-as-nasa-shows-july-was-hottest-on-record/" target="_self">this article</a> by Robertscribbler to see how heat records are currently being smashed around the world, and what the consequences are). There will come a year where the initial sea ice state is worse than this year, followed by above average preconditioning. Then add a July such as this one, and you have a recipe for near ice-free conditions come September. To think that this process is not going to affect anything or anyone, is even worse than not thinking at all.</p>&#13;
<p>---</p>&#13;
<p>I'd like to thank David Schröder and all his co-authors for taking the time and effort to provide me with their model results. It has been a huge help in assessing the direction this melting season has been taking.</p>
