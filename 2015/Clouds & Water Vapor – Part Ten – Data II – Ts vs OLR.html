					<p>[<em>I was going to post this new article not long after the last article in the series, but felt I was missing something important and needed to think about it. Instead I’ve not had any new insights and am posting for comment.</em>]</p>
<p>In <a href="http://scienceofdoom.com/2015/06/09/clouds-water-vapor-part-nine-data-i-ts-vs-olr/">Part Nine – Data I</a>, we looked at the relationship between Ts (surface temperature) and OLR (outgoing longwave radiation), for reasons all explained there.</p>
<p>The relationship shown there appears to be primarily the seasonal relationship, which looks like a positive feedback due to the 2W/m² per 1K temperature increase. What about the feedback on a different timescale from the seasonal relationship?</p>
<p>From the 2001-2013 data, here is the monthly mean and the daily mean for both Ts and OLR:</p>
<p><a href="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/monthly-mean-daily-mean-for-ts-olr.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9185" src="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/monthly-mean-daily-mean-for-ts-olr.png?w=500&amp;h=412" alt="Monthly mean &amp; daily mean for Ts &amp; OLR"/></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 1</em></p>
<p>If we <span>remove the monthly mean</span> from the data, here are those same relationships (shown in the last article as anomalies from the overall 2001-2013 mean):</p>
<p><a href="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/olr-vs-ts-ncar-ceres-monthlymeansremoved.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9187" src="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/olr-vs-ts-ncar-ceres-monthlymeansremoved.png?w=500&amp;h=447" alt="OLR vs Ts - NCAR -CERES-monthlymeansremoved"/></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 2 – Click to Expand</em></p>
<p>On a lag of 1 day there is a possible relationship with a low correlation – and the rest of the lags show no relationship at all.</p>
<p>Of course, we have created a problem with this new dataset – as the lag increases we are “jumping boundaries”. For example, on the 7-day lag all of the Ts data in the last week of April is being compared with the OLR data in the first week of May. With slowly rising temperatures, the last week of April will be “positive temperature data”, but the first week of May will be “negative OLR data”. So we expect 1/4 of our data to show the opposite relationship.</p>
<p>So we can show the data with the “monthly boundary jumps removed” – which means we can only show lags of say 1-14 days (with 3% – 50% of the data cut out); and we can also show the data as anomalies from the daily mean. Both have the potential to demonstrate the feedback on shorter timescales than the seasonal cycle.</p>
<p>First, here is the data with <strong>daily means</strong> removed:</p>
<p><a href="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/olr-vs-ts-ncar-ceres-dailymeansremoved.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9191" src="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/olr-vs-ts-ncar-ceres-dailymeansremoved.png?w=500&amp;h=431" alt="OLR vs Ts - NCAR -CERES-dailymeansremoved"/></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 3 – Click to Expand</em></p>
<p>Second, here is the data with the monthly means removed as in figure 2, but this time ensuring that no monthly boundaries are crossed (so some of the data is removed to ensure this):</p>
<p><a href="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/olr-vs-ts-ncar-ceres-monthlymeansremoved-noboundary.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9192" src="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/olr-vs-ts-ncar-ceres-monthlymeansremoved-noboundary.png?w=500&amp;h=448" alt="OLR vs Ts - NCAR -CERES-monthlymeansremoved-noboundary"/></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 4 – Click to Expand</em></p>
<p>So basically this demonstrates no correlation between change in daily global OLR and change in daily global temperature on less than seasonal timescales. (Or “operator error” with the creation of my anomaly data). <em>This is excluding (because we haven’t tested it here) the very short timescale of day to night change</em>.</p>
<p>This was surprising at first sight.</p>
<p>That is, we see global Ts increasing on a given day but we can’t distinguish any corresponding change in global OLR from random changes, at least until we get to seasonal time periods? (See graph in <a href="http://scienceofdoom.com/2015/06/09/clouds-water-vapor-part-nine-data-i-ts-vs-olr/">last article</a>).</p>
<p>Then what is probably the reason came into view. Remember that this is anomaly data (daily global temperature with monthly mean subtracted). This bar graph demonstrates that when we are looking at anomaly data, most of the changes in global Ts are reversed the next day, or usually within a few days:</p>
<p><a href="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/days-temperature-goes-in-same-direction.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9196" src="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/days-temperature-goes-in-same-direction.png?w=500" alt="Days temperature goes in same direction"/></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 5</em></p>
<p>This means that we are unlikely to see changes in Ts causing noticeable changes in OLR unless the climate response we are looking for (humidity and cloud changes) occurs within a day or two.</p>
<p>That’s my preliminary thinking, looking at the data – i.e., we can’t expect to see much of a relationship, and we don’t see any relationship.</p>
<p>One further point – explained in much more detail in the (short) series <a href="http://scienceofdoom.com/roadmap/measuring-climate-sensitivity/">Measuring Climate Sensitivity</a> – is that of course changes in temperature are not caused by some mechanism that is independent of radiative forcing.</p>
<p>That is, our measurement problem is compounded by changes in temperature being first caused by fluctuations in radiative forcing (the radiation balance) and ocean heat changes and then we are measuring the “resulting” change in the radiation balance resulting from this temperature change:</p>
<p>Radiation balance &amp; ocean heat balance =&gt; Temperature change =&gt; Radiation balance &amp; ocean heat balance</p>
<p>So we can’t easily distinguish the net radiation change caused by temperature changes from the radiative contribution to the original temperature changes.</p>
<p>I look forward to readers’ comments.</p>
