At the coordinates selected for each site, we extracted a 3×3 pixel array of thermal infrared data for each nighttime overpass. We eliminated cloudy pixels from the time series of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures using a subset of the cloud tests provided with the ATSR product and complemented by a spatial homogeneity test that excluded any arrays where the standard deviation of the 3×3 pixel array was greater than 0.5 °C.</p><p>We used the satellite data to calculate bulk water temperatures from skin temperatures using sensor-specific correction factors derived from the Laurentian Great Lakes<sup><a id="ref-link-section-75" title="Schneider, P. &amp; Hook, S.

Satellite observations indicate rapid warming trend for lakes in California and Nevada. Geophys. Res. Lett. 36, L22402 (2009)." href="/articles/sdata20158#ref63">63</a></sup>. We compiled time series from both series of satellite instruments independently at all 141 sites, with AVHRR data available for the period 1985–2009 and ATSR data available for the period 1991–2009. We then merged the cloud-free observations from both series of instruments into a single dataset to maximize the sampling frequency. This allows for more accurate estimates of the 3-month summer means.</p><h2>Geomorphometric characteristics</h2><p>We collected latitude, longitude, elevation, surface area, volume, mean depth, and maximum depth for each lake, if available (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Although these values are presented as static, we note that these variables could have varied during the 1985–2009 period, especially for reservoir systems. Whenever possible, metadata for each lake were obtained from the original data provider. For many of the lakes sampled using satellite imagery, very little morphometric information was readily available. In these cases, we conducted searches in the primary literature, online web sources (ILEC (<a href="http://www.ilec.or.jp/en/">http://www.ilec.or.jp/en/</a>), IAGLR (<a href="http://www.iaglr.org/">http://www.iaglr.org/</a>), LakeNet (<a href="http://www.worldlakes.org/">http://www.worldlakes.org/</a>), Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>)), Google Earth, or contacted colleagues in the relevant countries to obtain information.</p><h2>Air temperatures</h2><p>We obtained mean, minimum, maximum, and diurnal temperature range (defined as the difference between daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures) for summer, winter, and annual air temperature data for each lake from two separate sources: the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). We obtained the CRU data from version 3.21 of their dataset using 0.5-degree resolution grid cells<sup><a id="ref-link-section-78" title="Jones, P. &amp; Harris, I.

These data are monthly gridded files calculated from observations. Lake values were the mean of all months within the appropriate time period to match the sampling period (e.g., July-August-September for northern hemisphere summer, January-February-March for northern hemisphere winter), see Section G below) for a given year for the single grid cell that contained the sampling location for the lake. Exceptions included large bodies of water, such as Lake Superior and the Caspian Sea, which included an average of the grid cells that surrounded these lakes (because we used a land-based air temperature dataset, grid cells that were over only water did not have data).</p><p>The air temperature data we obtained from NCEP represent version 2 of the NCEP reanalysis data<sup><a id="ref-link-section-79" title="Kanamitsu, M. et al.

For lakes smaller than one cell on the T62 grid, we extracted data for the cell containing the latitude and longitude representing the approximate center of the lake.

The dataset has a spatial resolution of 1°× 1° and temporal resolution of 3 h. In addition to the SRB incoming shortwave radiation (<i>SW</i>) and longwave radiation (<i>LW</i>), we also provide estimates of the total incoming radiation (<i>R</i>

Results indicate that the downwelling solar irradiance shows good overall agreement with ground measurements, except for a few large biases in Southeast Asia (Sukothai, Bukit, and Kogma). These biases range from −90.2 W m<sup>−2</sup> (−22%) at Sukothai to +45.8 W m<sup>−2</sup> (+12.8%) at Bukit when comparing SRB solar radiation data with ground observations.

The NOAA 5-channel Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) cloud imagery record began in 1981, and cloud statistics derived using Pathfinder Atmosphere’s Extended (PATMOS-x) processing system are available with global coverage<sup><a id="ref-link-section-87" title="Heidinger, A.

We calculated mean cloud cover (0–1) during the summer and winter periods using the average of these daytime values for 1985–2009.</p><h2>Summer mean surface water temperature calculations</h2><p>We calculated summer mean temperatures for a 3-month period. Generally, for lakes situated in the Northern Hemisphere we used the period of 1 July—30 September (JAS); whereas, in the Southern Hemisphere, we used 1 January—31 March (JFM). Exceptions were latitudes less than 23.5°, for which the JAS metric was used south of the equator and the JFM metric was used north of the equator. This was done in order to avoid the cloudy wet season in the tropics and instead collect data during the dry season, which allows for an increased number of cloud-free satellite observations<sup><a id="ref-link-section-89" title="Schneider, P. &amp; Hook, S. J. Space observations of inland water bodies show rapid surface warming since 1985. Geophys. Res. Lett. 37, L224052010)." href="/articles/sdata20158#ref11">11</a></sup>. We use the term ‘summer’ throughout to refer to these time periods (JAS or JFM) depending upon location of the lake. The only exception to this time period was the <i>in situ</i> data for Toolik Lake, Alaska, for which we used June-August because of the lack of data available for September due to the early onset of winter at this high latitude. The term ‘winter’ refers to the 3-month period opposite ‘summer’ in the calendar year.</p><h3>
<i>In situ</i> mean calculations</h3><p>Assuming sampling for a given year preceded (or started on) the first interpolation date and extended past (or ended on) the last interpolation date, we used linear interpolation to create a daily value for all dates between the beginning and end of the interpolation period (inclusive). The summer mean was calculated by finding the mean of all of these daily values beginning on the first day of July and ending on the last day of September (for Northern Hemisphere lakes). We also calculated gap lengths, which were the intervals in days between sequential sampling times. Gaps were calculated only for the sampling points that existed within the seasonal bounds. We defined the maximum gap as the maximum of all gaps for a single year. The mean gap was the mean of all gaps for a single year. If sampling did not extend to or beyond the start and end dates of the interpolation period, we used a curve-fitting extrapolation routine (see below).</p><h3>Extrapolation of observations for shortened sampling periods</h3><p>Where necessary, we used a curve-fitting extrapolation technique to extend daily <i>in situ</i> observations to the bounds of the summer mean period. More specifically, we used temperature estimates from lake-specific curves to populate daily values for the missing part of the interpolation period. To generate the curve, we pooled all temperature values (for a given depth and given lake) according to day-of-year (DoY), and fit a curve of the type ‘temperature=a*DoY^2+b*DoY+c’. This equation yielded a generic representation of the seasonal pattern in the data. For years that did not have data that covered the full interpolation period, we used the curve fit to extrapolate values preceding the first sample point (if applicable) or beyond the last sample point (if applicable), or in some cases, both. The curve was adjusted along the Y (temperature) axis by modifying the value of c in the equation to intersect the first sample point (if missing data appeared during the early portion of the interpolation period) or last sample point (if there were missing data in the latter part of the interpolation period), and daily values were taken from the equation for the portion(s) missing from the record. When this routine was used, we made a notation in the log file describing if extrapolation was used for the beginning and/or end period and we included the equation of the curve (See Data Records).</p><h3>Satellite mean calculations</h3><p>As the satellite observations generally are not distributed evenly throughout each 3-month period, we used a robust locally weighted regression smoothing (LOWESS) approach<sup><a id="ref-link-section-90" title="Cleveland, W. S. Robust locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplots. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 74, 829–836 (1979)." href="/articles/sdata20158#ref72">72</a></sup> on a year-by-year basis for each time series. This technique provides a continuous temperature estimate and is robust against outliers in the observations helping to avoid sampling bias in the calculation of the 3-month mean. We computed a separate LOWESS fit for the temperature curve of each calendar year and at each inland water body. We subsequently computed the mean temperature of a 3-month period over all 92 daily values obtained from the fitted LOWESS curve. An average temperature was only computed if at least 20 valid cloud-free satellite retrievals were available in a given 3-month period, to ensure that the observations adequately characterize the temperature curve.</p></div></div>
