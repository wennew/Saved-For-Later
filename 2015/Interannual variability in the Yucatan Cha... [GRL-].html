		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Mooring measurements in the Yucatan Channel, from May 2010 to May 2011 and from July 2012 to June 2013 yield a mean transport of 27 and 25 Sv, respectively, with a subinertial standard deviation of 3.5 Sv. These mean transport values are higher than the 23 Sv reported from 21 months of similar measurements (1999–2001). Analysis of low-frequency variations of a transport proxy based on 20 years of altimetry data indicates that during 1999–2001, the flow through Yucatan Channel was anomalously low. This suggests that a sizable compensation through other channels off the Gulf of Mexico is required to match the transport cable measurements of the Florida Current at 27°N.</p></div>
