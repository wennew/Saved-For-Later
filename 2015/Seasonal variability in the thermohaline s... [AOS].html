A Δ<em>T</em>=–0.4°C is more suitable than other temperature criterion for determining the mixed layer (ML) and barrier layer (BL) over the WPWP using monthly-averaged temperature and salinity data. The WPWP has a particular thermohaline structure and can be vertically divided into three layers, i.e., the ML, BL, and deep layer (DL). The BL thickness (BLT) is the thickest, while the ML thickness (MLT) is the thinnest. The MLT has a similar seasonal variation to the DL thickness (DLT) and BLT. They are all thicker in spring and fall but thinner in summer. The temperatures of the ML and BL are both higher in spring and autumn but lower in winter and summer with an annual amplitude of 0.15°C, while the temperature of the DL is higher in May and lower in August. The averaged salinities at these three layers are all higher in March but lower in September, with annual ranges of 0.41–0.45. Zonal currents, i.e., the South Equatorial Current (SEC) and North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC), and winds may be the main dynamic factors driving the seasonal variability in the WPWP thermohaline structure, while precipitation and net heat fluxes are both important thermodynamic factors. Higher (lower) winds cause both the MLT and BLT to thicken (thin), a stronger (weaker) NECC induces MLT, BLT, and DLT to thin (thicken), and a stronger (weaker) SEC causes both the MLT and BLT to thicken (thin) and the DLT to thin (thicken). An increase (decrease) in the net heat fluxes causes the MLT and BLT to thicken (thin) but the DLT to thin (thicken), while a stronger (weaker) precipitation favors thinner (thicker) MLT but thicker (thinner) BLT and DLT. In addition, a stronger (weaker) NECC and SEC cause the temperature of the three layers to decrease (increase), while the seasonal variability in salinity at the ML, BL, and DL might be controlled by the subtropical cell (STC).</p>","direction":"ltr"}};
