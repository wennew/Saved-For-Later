Remote sensed SST imagery has proven to be an effective technique in oceanic eddy detection, because of its high temporal and spatial resolution. Various techniques have been used to identify eddies from SST images.

A scheme of algorithm based on quasi-contour tracing and clustering of eddy detection from SST dataset is presented.

Experiments proved that oceanic eddies ranging in diameter from tens to hundreds of kilometers can be detected. Through investigation of the 2007–2011 OSTIA daily SST dataset from the Kuroshio region in the East China Sea, we found that the most active regions for oceanic eddies are those along the Kuroshio path, northeast of Taiwan Island, the Yangtze Estuary and the Ryukyu Islands. About 86% of the cyclonic eddies and 87% of the anticyclonic eddies have the size of 50–100 km in diameter.
