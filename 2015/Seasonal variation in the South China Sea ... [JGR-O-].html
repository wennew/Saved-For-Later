		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The previous studies show that the SCS deep circulation is featured by a basin-scale cyclonic gyre. On the basis of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA), this study attempts to examine its seasonal variability and to investigate the driving mechanism. During summer season, the basin-scale cyclonic gyre is dominant and strong, corresponding to higher value of the deepwater overflow transport. During winter season, the basin-scale cyclonic gyre can hardly be identified, corresponding to lower value of the deepwater overflow transport. The control run and the SODA show the similar results. Two sensitivity experiments are designed to investigate what could be possible responsible for the seasonal variation in the SCS deep circulation. The results reveal that the deepwater overflow through the Luzon Strait contributes to the seasonal variability of the SCS deep circulation, and the seasonal variation of the surface forcings have less influence on that. The mechanism is related to the potential vorticity flux by the deepwater overflow. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>
