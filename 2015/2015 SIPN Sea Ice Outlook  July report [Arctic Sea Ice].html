These projections are submitted by professionals as well as amateurs (public outlooks).</p>\n<p>Here's the summary for the July report:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The median Outlook for September 2015 Arctic sea ice extent is 5.0 million square kilometers (km<sup>2</sup>), which is the same as the June Outlook median. The quartile range is 4.4 to 5.2 km<sup>2</sup> (see Figure 1 in the Overview section, below). Contributions are based on a range of methods: statistical, numerical models, estimates based on trends, and subjective information. The overall range (excluding an extreme outlier) is 3.3 to 5.7 million km<sup>2</sup>. The median Outlook value is up from the July 2014 median value of 4.8 million km<sup>2</sup>. These values compare to observed values of 4.3 million km<sup>2</sup> in 2007, 4.6 million km<sup>2</sup> in 2011, 3.6 million km<sup>2</sup> in 2012, and 5.3 million km<sup>2</sup> in 2014.

Another factor could be the lack of significant atmospheric or oceanic forcing that would result in a large change from the June forecasts. A discussion of 11 dynamical model contributions shows no major differences compared to last month's report.
