		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>To assess published hypotheses surrounding the recent slowdown in surface warming (hiatus) we compare five available global observational surface temperature estimates to two thirty member ensembles from the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM). Model ensembles are initialized in 1980 from the transient historical runs and driven with forcings used in the CMIP5 experiments and updated forcings based upon current observational understanding, described in Part 1. The ensembles’ surface temperature trends are statistically indistinguishable over 1998-2012 despite differences in the prescribed forcings. There is thus no evidence that forcing errors play a significant role in explaining the hiatus according to NorESM. The observations fall either towards the lower portion of the ensembles or, for some observational estimates and regions, outside. The exception is the Arctic where the observations fall towards the upper ensemble bounds. Observational dataset choices can make a large difference to findings of consistency or otherwise. Those NorESM ensemble members that exhibit nino3.4 SST trends similar to observed also exhibit comparable tropical and to some extent global-mean trends, supporting a role for ENSO in explaining the hiatus. Several ensemble members capture the marked seasonality observed in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude trends, with cooling in the wintertime and warming in the remaining seasons. Overall, we find that we cannot falsify NorESM as being capable of explaining the observed hiatus behavior. Importantly, this is not equivalent to concluding NorESM could simultaneously capture all important facets of the hiatus. Similar experiments with further, distinct, Earth System Models are required to verify our findings.</p></div>
