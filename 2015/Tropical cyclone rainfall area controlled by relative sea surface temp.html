					<h2>TC rainfall characteristics</h2><p>We determine TC rainfall area using two objective methods (see Methods) based on 11 years of satellite precipitation retrievals (the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or TRMM, 3B42 data set)<sup><a href="#ref20" title="Huffman, G. J. et al. The TRMM multi-satellite precipitation analysis: quasi-global, multi-year, combined-sensor precipitation estimates at fine scale. J. Hydrometeor. 8, 38–55 (2007) ." id="ref-link-28">20</a></sup> and 21 years of cloud brightness temperatures (Cloud Archive User Services, or CLAUS)<sup><a href="#ref21" title="Hodges, K., Chappell, D. W., Robinson, G. J. &amp; Yang, G. An improved algorithm for generating global window brightness temperatures from multiple satellite infra-red imagery. J. Atmos.Ocean Technol. 17, 1296–1312 (2000) ." id="ref-link-29">21</a></sup> in tandem with observed TC tracks from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Knapp, K.

Meteor. Soc. 91, 363–376 (2010) ." id="ref-link-30">22</a></sup>. We use these data to study the climatic controls on TC rainfall area. We use TC precipitation statistics from Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) high-resolution atmospheric model (HIRAM)<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Zhao, M., Held, I. M., Lin, S.-J. &amp; Vecchi, G. A. Simulations of global hurricane climatology, interannual variability, and response to global warming using a 50 km resolution GCM. J. Climate 22, 6653–6678 (2009) ." id="ref-link-31">23</a></sup> simulations at a 50-km resolution both to corroborate our observational findings and to examine the potential impacts of global warming induced by increasing concentrations of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on TC rainfall and size.</p><p>TC rainfall distributions and areas (see Methods) are stratified according to different categories of TC intensity and relative SST, where relative SST is defined as the SST in the TC environment minus the tropical (30°S-30°N) mean SST (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). The relationship between TC intensity and TC size (the horizontal direction in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>) is weak, consistent with previous results<sup><a href="#ref9" title="Merrill, R. T. A comparison of large and small tropical cyclones. Mon. Wea. Rev. 112, 1408–1418 (1984) ." id="ref-link-32">9</a></sup>. By contrast, there is a robust increase in the average TC rainfall area with increasing relative SST in all intensity categories (the vertical direction in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). The dependence of rainfall rate on intensity and relative SST is further illustrated in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>, which shows the radial distributions of azimuthally averaged rainfall rate for storms of different intensities within the [3 °C,4 °C] relative SST bin (row 5 in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>) and for tropical storms in different relative SST bins (column 1 in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). As expected, TC rainfall rate increases markedly with TC intensity, especially towards the storm centre, but rainfall radius (defined as the radius where the azimuthally averaged rainfall rate reaches a threshold rainfall rate, see Methods) changes little with TC intensity (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>). By contrast, high rainfall rates expand outwards to larger radii as relative SST increases (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f2">Fig. 2b</a>). Increases in rainfall area with relative SST mean that total TC rainfall also increases with relative SST.</p>

	<h2>Dependence of TC rainfall area and rate on SST</h2><p>TC rainfall area determined using both objective methods is typically largest in the Western North Pacific and smallest in the Eastern Pacific. This result is consistent with geographic variations in TC size metrics based on wind fields<sup><a href="#ref9" title="Merrill, R. T. A comparison of large and small tropical cyclones. Mon. Wea. Rev. 112, 1408–1418 (1984) ." id="ref-link-33">9</a>, <a href="#ref18" title="Chavas, D. R. &amp; Emanuel, K. A. A QuickSCAT climatology of tropical cyclone size. Geophys. Res. Lett. 37, L18816 (2010) ." id="ref-link-34">18</a>, <a href="#ref19" title="Knaff, J. A., Longmore, S. P. &amp; Molenar, D. A. An objective satellite-based tropical cyclone size climatology. J. Climate 27, 455–476 (2014) ." id="ref-link-35">19</a></sup>. The mean TC rainfall radius increases by ~100 km as relative SST increases from the [0 °C,1 °C] bin to the [3 °C,4 °C] bin (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). This result is qualitatively robust for all categories of TCs. Analysis of rainfall radii determined using an alternative objective method based on brightness temperatures also shows an increase in rainfall radius with relative SST (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f3">Fig. 3b</a>), although the mean radii are smaller because of differences in the methodology (See Methods). Furthermore, this dependence of TC rainfall size on relative SST is reproduced in an Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-type (that is, using historical SSTs and sea ice as boundary conditions) simulation using HIRAM (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f3">Fig. 3c</a>). The success of the model in simulating the TC size dependence suggests that the underlying mechanism may be relatively simple and controlled by large-scale atmospheric conditions rather than cumulus-scale dynamics. The strong dependence of TC size on relative SST can also be identified in an analysis of absolute SST, although the strength of the regression is slightly degraded (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>). Temporal fluctuations in tropical mean SST are relatively small, so that changes in relative and absolute SST are largely coherent. Both relative and absolute SST reflect regional SST variations in the present climate. We are therefore unable to differentiate between relative and absolute SST impacts on TC rainfall area based on observations alone.</p>

	<p>Two pairs of HIRAM experiments were conducted to examine the dependence of TC rainfall area and rate on relative and absolute SST. The first pair contrasts a 25-year control simulation with prescribed climatological (seasonally-varying) SSTs and sea ice with a perturbed simulation in which a uniform 2 K warming (relative to the control simulation) is imposed (P2K). The second pair contrasts an AMIP-type simulation that uses historical SSTs and sea ice from 1981 to 2009 as the lower boundary conditions with a simulation in which a uniform 4 K warming (relative to the AMIP simulation) is imposed (P4K). Global warming simulations use the same CO<sub>2</sub> concentration as the control to isolate the SST impacts from CO<sub>2</sub> impacts<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Held, I. M. &amp; Zhao, M. The response of tropical cyclone statistics to an increase in co2 with fixed sea surface temperatures. J. Clim. 24, 5353–5364 (2011) ." id="ref-link-36">24</a></sup>. Absolute SSTs increase by 2 and 4 K in the P2K and P4K simulations, but relative SSTs stay the same as the control and AMIP simulations. TC genesis locations and tracks are broadly similar in all of these simulations (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>).</p><p>The frequency distributions of TC rainfall radius based on all of these simulations are very similar (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). The overall increase in rainfall radius is only around 3 km for the P2K simulation (relative to the control simulation) and around 10 km for the P4K simulation (relative to the AMIP simulation). These small increases in rainfall radius are mainly due to increases in rainfall rate with increasing absolute SST (the rainfall rate threshold used in the method is fixed at 0.5 mm h<sup>−1</sup> (see <a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f5">Fig. 5</a> and Methods). The negligible change in TC rainfall area under global warming scenarios is in sharp contrast to the strong dependence of TC size on absolute SST, and is consistent with the hypothesis that rainfall area depends primarily on relative SST. This suggests that, to the first order, TC rainfall area is primarily controlled by relative SST instead of absolute SST. Relative SST has also been identified as better than absolute SST for explaining variations in Atlantic TC frequency<sup><a href="#ref5" title="Zhao, M. &amp; Held, I. M.

	<p>In contrast to the negligible change in rainfall area, rainfall rate changes significantly among these experiments, both within 100 km of the TC centre (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>) and within the TC rainfall area (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150312/ncomms7591/full/ncomms7591.html#f4">Fig. 4c</a>). Rainfall rate within 100 km of the TC centre increases by ~12% for the P2K experiment (relative to the control simulation) and ~25% for the P4K simulation (relative to the AMIP simulation). These increases decrease slightly to ~8% and ~18%, respectively, within the TC rainfall area. These increases in rainfall rate with absolute SST are consistent with previous studies<sup><a href="#ref6" title="Knutson, T. R. et al. Tropical cyclones and climate change. Nat.
