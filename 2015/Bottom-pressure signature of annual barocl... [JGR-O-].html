		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The annual cycle in bottom pressure (<em>p<sub>b</sub></em>) in the northeast tropical Pacific Ocean (NTPO) is studied. Focus is on a zonal section along 12°N between 105°W and 145°W that is characterized by a strong annual cycle in sea level from satellite altimetry. Estimates of <em>p<sub>b</sub></em> from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), a state estimate produced by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium, and a linear Rossby wave model (LRWM) are used. The GRACE NTPO <em>p<sub>b</sub></em> annual cycle shows amplitudes as large as 1 cm water equivalent. The GRACE data also evidence westward propagation that is consistent with the behavior of long mode-1 Rossby waves at this latitude, with phase increasing from east to west at a rate of ∼0.34 m s<sup>−1</sup>. The ECCO and LRWM <em>p<sub>b</sub></em> estimates corroborate the notion that GRACE reveals the <em>p<sub>b</sub></em> signature of annual Rossby waves driven by interior wind stress curl and possibly damped by frictional processes. Results have implications for attempts to constrain global ocean mass using a single point mooring.</p></div>
