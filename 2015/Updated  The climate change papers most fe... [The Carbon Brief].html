<p>Climate papers | Carbon Brief</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In our recent series on the top climate change&#13;
papers, we brought you which ones scientists think are the</span>&#13;
<a href="/blog/2015/07/the-most-influential-climate-change-papers-of-all-time/">&#13;
<span>most influential</span></a> <span>and which are the</span> <a href="/blog/2015/07/analysis-most-cited-climate-change-papers/"><span>&#13;
most cited</span></a> <span>by other researchers.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>With the help of</span> <a href="http://www.altmetric.com/"><span>Altmetric</span></a><span>,&#13;
we also looked into which research articles have made the biggest&#13;
splash in the news and on social media. But, as a few eagle-eyed&#13;
readers pointed out to us, it seems there were some papers that&#13;
were overlooked.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Altmetric has now expanded their search to make&#13;
sure no paper is missed. So here's our revised take on which papers&#13;
have made the biggest impact in the wider world.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Media mentions</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Altmetric tracks when academic papers are&#13;
mentioned in online news articles and on social media platforms,&#13;
such Twitter and Facebook. It collates these mentions and gives&#13;
each paper a</span> <a href="http://support.altmetric.com/knowledgebase/articles/83337-how-is-the-altmetric-score-calculated">&#13;
<span>score</span></a> <span>for how much attention it received.&#13;
Featuring in a major national newspaper will contribute a bigger&#13;
score to a paper than being in a niche publication. A paper with no&#13;
mentions will score zero, for example, while an article with a&#13;
score of</span> <a href="http://support.altmetric.com/knowledgebase/articles/234361-what-s-the-scale-for-the-altmetric-score">&#13;
<span>over 20</span></a> <span>has received significant attention&#13;
from journalists or perhaps caused a stir online.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>To match our analysis of the most cited climate&#13;
change papers, Altmetric ran a keyword search for papers mentioning&#13;
"climate change" or "global warming". However, the original&#13;
Altmetric search capped the number of papers it returned to 10,000,&#13;
which meant some high-scoring papers were missed off.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Altmetric's founder,</span> <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/about.php"><span>Euan&#13;
Adie</span></a><span>, explains to Carbon Brief:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"What I didn't realize&#13;
when pulling this data the first time round was that the search&#13;
engine I used to find articles with the two terms we were&#13;
interested in only returned the 'most relevant' results. Instead of&#13;
17,000 results we got back 10,000, and amongst the missing articles&#13;
were many that, to be consistent, should have been in the top 100.&#13;
This means the original data was incomplete and the ranking was&#13;
out; the updated data fixes this."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Altmetric have now extended this cap to 20,000&#13;
papers, and intend to remove the cap completely in the near future.&#13;
You can try out the tool yourself with the</span> <a href="http://www.altmetric.com/explorer.php#tab=articles"><span>Altmetric&#13;
Explorer</span></a><span>.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>From the new set of search results, we filtered&#13;
out all the entries that were news, editorials and books, leaving&#13;
just research articles to analyse, which we then trimmed to a top&#13;
100.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Unfortunately, this did mean cutting out the&#13;
highest-scoring climate change article of any kind, which was a&#13;
spoof</span> <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v520/n7545/full/520042a.html">&#13;
<span>News &amp; Views piece</span></a> <span>in Nature on the&#13;
reemergence of dragons due to warmer temperatures, published on 1st&#13;
April this year. Â </span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, one point to note is that Altmetric&#13;
only started tracking papers in July 2011, so this analysis only&#13;
covers papers published over the past four years.</span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>So what research have we all been reading and&#13;
tweeting about?</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Top paper</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top-ranked article is "</span><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850"><span>High-Resolution&#13;
Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change</span></a><span>"&#13;
by lead author</span> <a href="http://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Hansen/Matthew%20C."><span>&#13;
Prof Matthew Hansen</span></a> <span>at the</span> <a href="http://www.umd.edu/"><span>University of Maryland</span></a>&#13;
<span>in the US, which was published in November 2013.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The paper describes how the researchers used&#13;
satellite data to map global forest change between 2000 and 2012.&#13;
They found that forest losses of around 2.3m square kilometers (sq&#13;
km) outweighed gains of 0.8m sq km. With the help of</span> <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/earth/"><span>Google&#13;
Earth</span></a><span>, the team created an</span> <a href="http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest">&#13;
<span>interactive mapping tool</span></a> <span>to show changes in&#13;
forests down to a resolution of just 30 metres.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Hansen and his colleagues found forest clearance&#13;
was largest in the tropics, with increases in deforestation in&#13;
Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia and Angola&#13;
offsetting a reduction in Brazil.</span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>The paper ranked second is "</span><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/"><span>Quantifying&#13;

Queensland</span></a> <span>in Australia. (This had appeared at&#13;
number one when Altmetric first did its search for the original&#13;
version of this article.)</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The paper analysed around 12,000 journal&#13;
articles about climate change and found 97% agreed that humans were&#13;
the principal cause. This figure - and the paper - received a lot&#13;
of attention from the press, featuring in no less than 18 articles&#13;
in The Guardian, 12 in Huffington Post, and even on comedian John&#13;
Oliver's</span> <a href="/blog/2015/04/10-of-the-best-youtube-videos-on-climate-change/">&#13;
<span>Last Week Tonight</span></a><span>. Though it's worth&#13;
mentioning that one of the paper's authors,</span> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dana-nuccitelli"><span>Dana&#13;
Nuccitelli</span></a><span>, also writes for The Guardian website,&#13;
and penned around half of their 18 articles.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Quantifying something as complicated as&#13;
consensus is not straightforward, and</span> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421514002821">&#13;
<span>not everyone agreed</span></a> <span>with the approach the&#13;
paper took. This perhaps makes the paper all the more newsworthy as&#13;
it</span> <a href="/blog/2014/06/what-consensus-means-to-climate-scientists/"><span>&#13;
prompted a lot of debate</span></a> <span>around what consensus&#13;
means and how it can be measured.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The paper has been mentioned widely on social&#13;
media as well. It was tweeted 1,272 times - including a</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/barackobama/status/335089477296988160"><span>&#13;

30% of known gas and oil reserves respectively. The paper featured&#13;
