		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The Nordic Seas overflows are an important part of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). While there is growing evidence that the overflow of dense water changed on orbital timescales during the Holocene, less is known about the variability on shorter timescales beyond the instrumental record. Here we reconstruct the relative changes in flow strength of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), the eastern branch of the overflows, on multidecadal–millennial timescales. The reconstruction is based on mean sortable silt (<img alt="inline image" src="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2014PA002737/asset/equation/palo20202-math-0001.png?v=1&amp;t=i974wwbe&amp;s=f3544d76ff10882981d88196ba08b59931580cce">) from a sediment core on the Gardar Drift (60°19N, 23°58W, 2081m).
