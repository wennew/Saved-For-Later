We conducted 13 cruises in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a region strongly influenced by fresh water and nutrients delivered from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River system. The sea surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (<em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub>) was measured, and the air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux was calculated. Results show that CO<sub>2</sub> exchange exhibited a distinct seasonality: the study area was a net sink of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during spring and early summer, and it was neutral or a weak source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere during midsummer, fall, and winter. Along the salinity gradient, across the shelf, the sea surface shifted from a source of CO<sub>2</sub> in low-salinity zones (0≤S&lt;17) to a strong CO<sub>2</sub> sink in the middle-to-high-salinity zones (17≤S&lt;33), and finally was a near-neutral state in the high-salinity areas (33≤S&lt;35) and in the open gulf (S≥35). High <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> values were only observed in narrow regions near freshwater sources, and the distribution of undersaturated <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> generally reflected the influence of freshwater inputs along the shelf. Systematic analyses of <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> variation demonstrated the importance of riverine nitrogen export; that is, riverine nitrogen-enhanced biological removal, along with mixing processes, dominated <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> variation along the salinity gradient. In addition, extreme or unusual weather events were observed to alter the alongshore <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> distribution and to affect regional air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux estimates. Overall, the study region acted as a net CO<sub>2</sub> sink of 0.96 ± 3.7 mol m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> (1.15 ± 4.4 Tg C yr<sup>−1</sup>).</p></div></div>
