As we\nwanted to look at both the top papers and all papers far beyond the\ntop 100, we wouldn't have manually been able to filter out all the\nnon-climate papers for the analysis.

</div>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>On Monday, we</span> <a href="/blog/2015/07/the-most-influential-climate-change-papers-of-all-time/">&#13;
<span>revealed the results</span></a> <span>of our survey of&#13;
scientists in which we asked them to name the "most influential"&#13;
climate change papers of all time. The most popular nomination&#13;
was</span> <span>a</span> <a href="/blog/2015/07/prof-john-mitchell-how-a-1967-study-greatly-influenced-climate-change-science/">&#13;
<span>seminal paper</span></a> <span>by Syukuro Manabe and Richard&#13;
T Wetherald published in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences in&#13;
1967.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Now, we turn from the subjective to the&#13;
objective and look at which are the most "cited" climate change&#13;
papers. Here,</span> <span>Carbon Brief analyses which papers have&#13;
had the biggest impact in the academic world, and who wrote&#13;
them.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Thousands of peer-reviewed academic papers are&#13;
published about climate change every year. These articles form the&#13;
bedrock of climate science, underpinning the assessment reports&#13;
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#13;
(IPCC).</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>With so many papers from so many journals, some&#13;
inevitably sink without trace. But others become the centrepiece of&#13;
their field or spark new areas of research.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Published papers</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are various databases to search through&#13;
which list the thousands of academic papers published each year.&#13;
Amidst options such as</span> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/"><span>Google&#13;
Scholar</span></a> <span>and</span> <a href="http://thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/scholarly-scientific-research/scholarly-search-and-discovery/web-of-science.html">&#13;
<span>Web of Science</span></a><span>, we plumped for</span> <a href="http://www.scopus.com/"><span>Scopus</span></a><span>, the&#13;
world's</span> <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus/resource-library/article/quick-facts-and-figures">&#13;
<span>largest abstract and citation database</span></a> <span>of&#13;
peer-reviewed literature.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Scopus, we searched for any academic paper&#13;
with the phrase 'climate change' or 'global warming' in its title,&#13;
abstract or keywords. We also tried using just 'climate' for the&#13;
searches, but that produced a very broad range of articles. As we&#13;
wanted to look at both the top papers and all papers far beyond the&#13;
top 100, we wouldn't have manually been able to filter out all the&#13;
non-climate papers for the analysis. So we went with 'climate&#13;
change' and 'global warming', though this does mean that some&#13;
climate change papers without those terms in the title, abstract or&#13;
keywords would miss out.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>But in response to queries from some</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/ClimateOfGavin/status/618772171826036736">&#13;
<span>climate</span></a><a href="https://twitter.com/polar_james/status/618773033210224640"><span>&#13;
scientists</span></a><span>, we've also, for comparison, included&#13;
the top 10 'climate' papers at the end of the article.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>We then limited the search to give us only pure&#13;
research articles, filtering out other publications such as book&#13;
chapters, conference papers, review articles and&#13;
editorials.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>The search yields a total of almost&#13;
120,000 papers, as of the beginning of June this year. You can see&#13;
below how the number of published papers about climate change took&#13;
off during the 2000s.</span></span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>As the chart below shows, most of the papers&#13;
relate to environmental science (25% of papers), earth and&#13;
planetary science (22%) and agricultural and biological sciences&#13;
(16%). But the search also unearths papers from social science&#13;
(8%), medicine (3%) and even dentistry (0%, or 4&#13;
papers).</span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>But while the number of publications shows how&#13;
prolific a researcher is, it doesn't reveal how influential their&#13;
work is. To do that we need to look at citations.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Citation, citation, citation</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In an academic paper, scientists will refer to&#13;
previous work by other scientists in their field.  This may be&#13;
to set the scene of their research or acknowledge a method or&#13;
finding that someone else produced. In doing this they refer to, or&#13;
'cite', other academic papers.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Databases such as Scopus keep track of how many&#13;
times each paper has been cited by others.</span> <span>We&#13;
extracted the 100 most cited climate change papers.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top paper, with 3,305 citations, is Nature&#13;
paper, "</span> <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6918/abs/nature01286.html">&#13;
<span>A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts&#13;
across natural systems</span></a><span>", by</span> <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/camille-parmesan"><span>Prof&#13;
Camille Parmesan</span></a><span>, at the</span> <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/"><span>University of Texas</span></a>&#13;
<span>and</span> <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/"><span>Plymouth&#13;
University</span></a><span>, and</span> <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6918/abs/nature01286.html">&#13;
<span>Prof Gary Yohe</span></a><span>, from</span> <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/"><span>Wesleyan&#13;
University</span></a><span>.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Published in 2003, the paper assessed the global&#13;
impact of climate change on more than 1,700 biological species,&#13;
from birds and butterflies to trees and alpine herbs. Parmesan and&#13;
Yohe found that 279 species are already being affected by climate&#13;
change, and 74-91% of these changes agree with what is expected&#13;
from projections.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>This paper also featured in our analysis as one&#13;
of the papers that IPCC authors considered the</span> <a href="/blog/2015/07/the-most-influential-climate-change-papers-of-all-time/">&#13;
<span>most influential</span></a><span>.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In runners-up spot is an Ecological Modelling&#13;
paper from 2000, "</span> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380000003549">&#13;
<span>Predictive habitat distribution models in&#13;

written by</span> <a href="http://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home/menuinst/people/group-leaders/prof-antoine-guisan.html">&#13;

published in Nature, with 2,562 citations. This 2004 paper has 19&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Crossover</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Apart from the Parmesan and Yohe article, just&#13;
one of our top</span> <a href="/blog/2015/07/the-most-influential-climate-change-papers-of-all-time/">&#13;
<span>most influential</span></a> <span>papers according to IPCC&#13;
authors makes the top 100 of most cited. This is the</span> <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/loi/clim"><span>Journal of&#13;
Climate</span></a> <span>paper "</span><a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3990.1"><span>&#13;
Robust responses of the hydrological cycle to global&#13;
warming</span></a><span>", by</span> <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/isaac-held-homepage"><span>Prof&#13;
Isaac Held</span></a> <span>and</span> <a href="https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/people/faculty-index?p=brian-soden">&#13;
<span>Prof Brian Soden</span></a><span>, which comes in&#13;
34th.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>So where are the climatic luminaries of</span>&#13;
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/faculty/manabe/"><span>Syukuro&#13;
Manabe</span></a><span>,</span> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-22283372"><span>Guy&#13;
Callendar</span></a> <span>and</span> <a href="http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/charles_david_keeling_biography"><span>&#13;
Charles Keeling</span></a><span>? Well, primarily,</span>&#13;
<span>Scopus doesn't yet have complete citations for papers&#13;
published before 1996, so older papers might be underrepresented in&#13;
the top 100 most cited.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>But another reason could be that papers tend to&#13;
have more citations in recent years because there are more papers&#13;
on climate change being published, so more opportunities to be&#13;
cited. This is reflected in the top 100, where most are from 2000&#13;
onwards, and none before 1988.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Likewise, very recent papers don't appear in the&#13;
top 100 because they haven't been around long enough to accrue&#13;
citations. The most recent paper in the top 100 was published in&#13;
2011.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Most appearances</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>So we've looked at which authors produce the&#13;
most papers, but which have appeared most often in the top 100 of&#13;
cited papers? No researcher appeared more than twice as a lead&#13;
author, but four appeared as at least a co-author in five&#13;
papers.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Featuring in this group is, once again, Prof&#13;
Ciais. But alongside him with five papers are</span> <a href="http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/who_is_who/pep_canadell.htm">&#13;
<span>Dr Josep Canadell</span></a><span>, the executive director of&#13;
the Global Carbon Project at the Commonwealth Scientific and&#13;
Industrial Research Organisation (</span><a href="http://www.csiro.au/"><span>CSIRO</span></a><span>) in&#13;
Australia,</span> <a href="http://www.whrc.org/about/cvs/rhoughton.html"><span>Dr&#13;
Richard Houghton</span></a><span>, a senior scientist at</span> <a href="http://www.whrc.org/"><span>Woods Hole Research&#13;
Center</span></a> <span>in Massachusetts, and</span> <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/c.prentice"><span>Prof Colin&#13;
Prentice</span></a><span>, professor of life sciences at</span> <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/"><span>Imperial College&#13;
London</span></a><span>.  </span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Beyond the leading four, another two researchers&#13;
are authors on four papers, and a further ten have authored three.&#13;
This makes up a top 16 of authors behind the 100 most cited papers,&#13;
which you can see in the graphic below.</span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Western focus</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>We also looked at which institutions were behind&#13;
the top 100 papers. This time we just concentrated on the primary&#13;
institution that each paper's lead author was affiliated&#13;
to.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Two come out top, with six papers each:&#13;
the</span> <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/"><span>University of&#13;
East Anglia</span></a><span>, and the</span> <a href="http://ncar.ucar.edu/"><span>National Center for Atmospheric&#13;
Research</span></a> <span>in the US. In total, there are 17&#13;
institutions with at least two papers in the top 100.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Looking at the countries where these&#13;
institutions reside, there is a prominent leaning towards western&#13;
countries in the northern hemisphere. The US and the UK dominate,&#13;
with almost three-quarters of the top 100 papers.</span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The rest are sprinkled through Europe, with a&#13;
few further afield, including Australia, China and Costa&#13;
Rica.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>For comparison, we've also mapped which&#13;
countries all 120,000 papers were authored from. Although note this&#13;
isn't a direct comparison, because this data include the locations&#13;
of all the authors on each paper, not just the lead.</span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>You can see again that researchers in the US and&#13;
UK are responsible for the bulk of climate change papers, but,&#13;
interestingly, China comes in third with 7%. Looking into the data,&#13;
over a fifth of these papers have an author from the Chinese&#13;
Academy of Sciences.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In fact, according to Scopus, over 2,200 of all&#13;
120,000 papers have at least one author from the Chinese Academy,&#13;
though just one makes into our top 100 most cited.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Top journals</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">Finally, we looked at where our top 100 most-cited&#13;
papers were published. And there were no surprises here. Top of the&#13;
tree are journal powerhouses <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html">Nature</a> (27&#13;
papers) and <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/magazine">Science</a> (26),&#13;

<p dir="ltr">But do Nature and Science only come out top because&#13;
they publish the most articles on climate change? According to&#13;
Scopus, it seems not.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Of all 120,000 papers, most were published&#13;
by</span> <a href="http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/agu/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1944-8007/">&#13;
<span>Geophysical Research Letters</span></a> <span>(3,057 papers),&#13;
followed by Journal of Climate (2,600) and</span> <a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/10584"><span>Climatic&#13;
Change</span></a> <span>(2,200). Nature comes in 12th (839) and&#13;
Science way down in 20th (625).</span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>As we mentioned earlier, searching for papers on&#13;
"climate change" or "global warming" may mean overlooking some&#13;
climate-related papers that don't necessarily have these terms in&#13;
their title, abstract or keywords. So, for comparison, below is the&#13;
top 10 most cited "climate" papers.</span></p>&#13;
