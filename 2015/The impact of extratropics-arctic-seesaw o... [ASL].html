		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Seesaw pattern of the perturbation potential energy in the extratropics and the Arctic (defined as PEAS) is observed. The PEAS is closely related to the Arctic Oscillation, kinetic energy and zonal wind in the middle- and high-latitude. The PEAS may influence atmospheric circulation via northern migration of anomalous Ferrel cell, accompanying by suppressed subtropical jet stream and enhanced polar jet stream. Anomalous warm conditions associated with the PEAS are observed in high-latitude of Eurasia, whereas cold anomalies are presented in Greenland, northeast Africa and southwest China, which is mainly attributed to the horizontal temperature advection.</p></div>
