While the model with no-TC initial conditions can quickly spin up TCs within a week, the initial conditions with a corrected TC distribution can produce more accurate forecast of sea surface temperature up to one and half months and maintain larger ocean heat content up to 6 months due to enhanced mixing from continuous interactions between initialized and forecasted TCs and the evolving ocean states.
