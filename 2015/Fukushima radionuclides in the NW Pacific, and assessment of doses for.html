	<p>Due to the influence of the specific current system offshore Fukushima (the Oyashio current bringing cold waters from the north, and the Kuroshio current bringing warm waters from the south), the region is well known for fast transport of seawater to the open Pacific Ocean<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Nakano, M. &amp; Povinec, P.

Assuming that the surface <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations in seawater within 20 km off the FDNPP decreased exponentially during the period of April 2012 to March 2014, we calculated an apparent half-life of <sup>137</sup>Cs at each site (<a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#t1">Table 1</a>), which ranged from 11 months to 18 months. The longest apparent half-life of <sup>137</sup>Cs in surface waters appeared at the north and south outlet sites near the FDNPP, whereas the shortest half-lives were observed at the sites distant from the FDNPP. These findings suggest a continuous supply of <sup>137</sup>Cs into coastal waters near the FDNPP.

P., Hirose, K. &amp; Aoyama, M. Fukushima Accident: Radioactivity Impact on the Environment (Elsevier, New York, 2013)." id="ref-link-105">2</a>).</p><p>We further examined temporal variations of radiocesium concentrations in demersal fish during the period of April 2012 to April 2014 using the MAFF data<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, MAFF, Results of the inspection on strontium in fisheries products.

The observed <sup>137</sup>Cs levels were gradually decreasing during the sampling period, although there was large variability of the radiocesium concentrations between fish samples (<a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#f4">Fig. 4</a>). Assuming that the radiocesium concentrations showed an exponential decrease with time, the apparent half-lives of radiocesium in Common Skete (<i>Raja kenojei</i>), Bastard halibut (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>), and Fat greenling (<i>Hexagrammos otakii</i>) were calculated to be 10 ± 1, 8.5 ± 0.5 and 12 ± 2 months, respectively, corresponding to 12 ± 1, 10.1 ± 0.6 and 15 ± 3 months of apparent half-lives of <sup>137</sup>Cs in demersal fish, of a similar time scale as 11–18 months of apparent half-lives of <sup>137</sup>Cs in coastal waters.</p><p>The <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations in fish caught in the open ocean before the Fukushima accident were following the decrease of the <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations in surface waters of the NW (North-West) Pacific Ocean<sup><a href="#ref33" title="Hirose, K. &amp; Aoyama, M.

These findings suggest that the radiocesium concentrations in surface waters control trends of the radiocesium concentrations in marine fish, irrespective of species of fish, which lives in the corresponding sea area. For the coastal area off Fukushima, where the water depth is relatively shallow (less than 100 m), no significant difference between <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations in surface and bottom waters is expected.</p><p>The MAFF results revealed that the radiocesium concentrations in some species of demersal fish showed large variability, exceeding the regulatory limit of 100 Bq/kg ww even in early 2014. Therefore Japanese government continues to keep fisheries closed offshore Fukushima. The average values of the radiocesium concentrations in Common Skete, Bastard halibut, and Fat greenling in March 2014, estimated from the best-fit curve (<a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#f4">Fig. 4</a>), were 25, 4.7 and 15 Bq/kg ww, respectively. These values were thus significantly lower than the regulatory limit of 100 Bq/kg. To elucidate the amount of scatter in measured values, ratios of measured values to values calculated from the exponential regression (R<sub>Cs,fish</sub>, in which trends of the radiocesium concentrations in fish are reduced), were calculated (<a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#f5">Fig. 5</a>). The logarithmic ratios showed normal distribution, in which standard derivations of the logarithmic ratios for Common Skete (number of samples: 487), Bastard halibut (number of samples: 2312), and Fat greenling (number of samples: 688) were 0.449, 0.495 and 0.596, respectively. Taken into account the 95% confidence interval of measured values, most of the observed radiocesium concentrations in Common Skete, Bastard halibut, and Fat greenling were less than 190, 44 and 220 Bq kg<sup>−1</sup> ww, respectively. The results suggest that the radiocesium concentration in Bastard halibut was within the regulatory limit at the 95% confidence interval on March 2013, whereas the higher measured radiocesium values in Common Skete and Fat greenling, statistically exceeded the regulatory limit in 2014 due to the slow decrease rates of radiocesium in demersal fish.</p>

	<p>The large scatter of the measured values of the radiocesium concentrations in demersal fish are primarily attributable to heterogeneous distribution of radiocesium in coastal waters near the FDNPP, which is related to continuous direct releases of contaminated waters, and due to ecological behaviors of demersal fish. The radiation dose due to annual intake of radiocesium in fish, which is important factor to determine the regulatory limit, is statistically related to the mean value of the radiocesium concentrations in fish rather than its maximum value. The large scatter of measured values in fish should be taken into account when to apply the regulatory limit.</p><p>For comparison radiocesium levels in other marine biota were in the range 70–430 Bq/kg dw for macroalgae, and 50–400 Bq/kg dw for mussels<sup><a href="#ref34" title="Baumann, Z. et al.

The Japanese approach, which has been thus very conservative, has been based on large consumption amounts of seafood, as well on the fact to make provisional regulation limits to be safer from the point of view of total dose commitments from other radiation/contamination sources, such as inhalation, external irradiation and the ingestion of terrestrial food. National and regional Japanese institutions have carried out extensive monitoring programs to exclude those seafood items, which were over the radionuclide concentration limit. This has also been done outside of Japan, e.g. the monitoring program of the European Union did not find imported seafood, which would be over the claimed Japanese radionuclide limit of 100 Bq/kg ww<sup><a href="#ref46" title="European Commission, EC, Management Plan.

The resulting dose rates can be then adjusted for possible deviations, both in the radionuclide levels in the seafood, as well as in the consumption rate of seafood. The approach based on the regulation limits<sup><a href="#ref1" title="Japanese Government, Report of the Japanese Government on the Fukushima Accident.

If we take for the average <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentrations off Fukushima (20 km radius) during 2011, 2012 and 2013 values of 500 (Ref. <a href="#ref2" title="Povinec, P.

The total effective dose commitment calculated for the period 2011–2013 is then estimated to be 0.5 ± 0.3 mSv/y (0.4 mSv/y from consumption of fish, 0.03 mSv/y from shellfish and 0.06 mSv/y from seaweed).</p><p>Due to rapid changes of radionuclide contents in seawater and in corresponding fish there are also problems with application of the Method 2 for dose assessments. As fish can migrate several tens of kilometers, the radionuclide concentrations in seawater, and resulting radionuclide levels in affected fish could change over the migration distance by several orders of magnitude. This of course should not be a problem for other types of seafood (e.g. seaweed, mussels and shellfish), which are either fixed on the seafloor, or the travelling distances are small.</p><p>The majority of radiocesium concentrations measured in fish were in the range 10–1000 Bq/kg ww, although the observed levels varied between 2011–2014 from about 0.5 Bq/kg ww to about 20 kBq/kg ww (<a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#f3">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#f4">4</a>).

The total effective dose commitment calculated for the period 2011–2013 is then estimated to be 0.3 ± 0.2 mSv/y, in a reasonable agreement with the value of 0.5 ± 0.3 mSv/y calculated using the Method 1. The results presented in <a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#f5">Fig. 5</a> suggest, however, that the higher measured radiocesium values in Common Skete and Fat greenling statistically exceeded the regulatory limit even in 2014. Therefore to be on a conservative side, for calculation of dose for the year 2013 we also use the screening value of 100 Bq/kg ww, which would result then in more robust dose estimation as the available fish data have been too scarce. The resulting total effective dose commitment for the period 2011–2013 will be then 0.4 ± 0.3 mSv/y (0.3 mSv/y from consumption of fish, 0.03 mSv/y from shellfish and 0.03 mSv/y from seaweed). By combining results obtained by both methods we may conclude that the radiation doses from consumption of <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>134</sup>Cs in contaminated seafood collected in coastal waters during 2011–2013 should be 0.5 ± 0.3 mSv/y.</p><p>For a critical group consuming fish with <sup>137</sup>Cs content of 1000 Bq/kg ww, and the seafood amounts by a factor of 4 higher as the Japanese average per year (i.e. the total consumption of seafood of 100 kg/y), the total dose including <sup>134</sup>Cs and other pathways will be about 3 ± 2 mSv/y, slightly higher than the world average dose from natural radiation sources (2.4 mSv/y).</p><h3>Radiation doses from consumption of seafood from the open Pacific Ocean</h3><p>There has been a fast seawater transport due to the Kuroshio Current and the Kuroshio Extension from the Japanese coast to the open North Pacific Ocean<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Nakano, M. &amp; Povinec, P.

Therefore in such situation, and for some fish species, which migrate in the ocean for large distances, it is difficult to estimate radiation doses for public from fish caught in the Pacific Ocean. For example some types of fish (e.g. Yellow tuna or Bluefin tuna) can migrate from Japan to California coastal waters<sup><a href="#ref18" title="Madigan, D. J., Baumann, Z. &amp; Fisher, N. S.

Therefore the dose assessment was done using the Method 1 by multiplying radionuclide concentrations in water with the concentration factors <i>(CF)<sub>j,k</sub></i>.</p><p>As the radionuclide data density for the open ocean is very sparse, we shall apply a very conservative approach and take for the <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentration in the NW Pacific Ocean the maximum observed value of 100 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> (Refs. <a href="#ref2" title="Povinec, P.

Dispersion of Fukushima radionuclides in the global atmosphere and the ocean. Appl. Rad. Isotopes 81, 383-392 (2013)." id="ref-link-140">47</a>). The effective dose commitment for ingestion of <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs in fish caught in 2011–2013 at the open NW Pacific Ocean was estimated to be 0.06 ± 0.04 mSv/y for all pathways. For more realistic average <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentration in the NW Pacific Ocean of about 10 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> (Ref. <a href="#ref2" title="Povinec, P. P., Hirose, K. &amp; Aoyama, M. Fukushima Accident: Radioactivity Impact on the Environment (Elsevier, New York, 2013)." id="ref-link-141">2</a>), the calculated dose would be only 0.006 mSv/y. If we calculate the dose following the Method 2 using the maximum measured <sup>137</sup>Cs activity in fish in the open NW Pacific Ocean (40 Bq/kg ww<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, MAFF, Results of the inspection on strontium in fisheries products.

The estimated dose is much lower than the annual dose limit for public from external sources (1 mSv/y) recommended by ICRP and IAEA. Because the dose is proportional to the consumption amount of contaminated seafood, most public in the world will get even lower doses than the Japanese population.</p><h3>Radiation doses from other radionuclides</h3><p>Atmospheric and liquid releases of other radionuclides from the damaged FDNPP were much lower when compared with cesium radioisotopes. From about 30 radionuclides released from the FDNPP and deposited or directly released to the marine environment<sup><a href="#ref48" title="Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, NISA, Regarding the evaluation of the conditions on reactor cores of Units 1, 2 and 3 related to the accident at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

P. Long-term simulations of the 137Cs dispersion from the Fukushima accident in the world ocean. J. Environ. Radioact. 111, 109-115 (2012)." id="ref-link-144">23</a></sup>. Only <sup>90</sup>Sr because of its radiological significance and large release rates may be considered important for delivering radiation doses to the public from consumption of contaminated seafood<sup><a href="#ref2" title="Povinec, P. P., Hirose, K. &amp; Aoyama, M. Fukushima Accident: Radioactivity Impact on the Environment (Elsevier, New York, 2013)." id="ref-link-145">2</a></sup>. The available data on <sup>90</sup>Sr activity concentrations in seawater and biota are, however, very limited when compared with radiocesium data. As the <sup>90</sup>Sr/<sup>137</sup>Cs activity ratios in Fukushima coastal waters varied considerably after the Fukushima accident (from 0.005 to about 500) because of different release rates of both radionuclides, it is difficult to assess effective dose commitments due to <sup>90</sup>Sr from consumption of seafood. A maximum effective dose due to <sup>90</sup>Sr from ingestion of seafood, however, may be calculated using the average <sup>90</sup>Sr level of 1 kBq/m<sup>3</sup> (<a href="/srep/2015/150312/srep09016/full/srep09016.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>) observed near the Fukushima coast, the dose conversion factor for <sup>90</sup>Sr of 2.8 × 10<sup>−8</sup> Sv/Bq<sup><a href="#ref49" title="International Commission on Radiological Protection, ICRP, Age-Dependent Doses to the Members of the Public from Intake of Radionuclides - Part 5: Compilation of Ingestion and Inhalation Coefficients.

A maximum effective dose commitment for ingestion of <sup>90</sup>Sr in fish caught in 2011–2013 at the Fukushima coast near the FDNPP was calculated to be 0.05 mSv/y. Taken into account the results that the <sup>90</sup>Sr levels in the open NW Pacific waters were less than 10 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> (Ref. <a href="#ref42" title="Povinec, P. P. et al. Cesium, iodine and tritium in NW Pacific waters - a comparison of the Fukushima impact with global fallout. Biogeosciences 10, 5481-5496 (2013)." id="ref-link-147">42</a>), the effective dose commitment for ingestion of <sup>90</sup>Sr in seafood collected in the NW Pacific Ocean should be less than 0.5 <span class="mb">μ</span>Sv/y. If we use for the dose calculation the maximum observed <sup>90</sup>Sr activity in fish caught in the NW Pacific Ocean (1 Bq/kg ww<sup><a href="#ref32" title="Povinec, P. P. et al.

The <sup>90</sup>Sr contribution to the total delivered doses may be thus about 10% for consumption of both the coastal and open ocean fish.

		<h3>Dose uncertainties</h3><p>There are several factors, which could contribute to the dose uncertainties. In the Method 1 the dominant contribution is from the estimation of a proper radionuclide concentration in seawater. As we took a rather conservative approach, the <sup>137</sup>Cs radionuclide concentrations in coastal waters used in calculations were at the upper side of observed values. Larger variations in radionuclide levels are expected for open ocean radionuclide concentrations<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Nakano, M. &amp; Povinec, P. P. Long-term simulations of the 137Cs dispersion from the Fukushima accident in the world ocean. J. Environ. Radioact. 111, 109-115 (2012)." id="ref-link-150">23</a></sup>, where we used either the maximum observed <sup>137</sup>Cs value of 100 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>, or an expected average value of 10 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>. According to IAEA<sup><a href="#ref50" title="International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Sources of Radioactivity in the Marine Environment and their RelativeContributions to Overall Dose Assessment from Marine Radioactivity. IAEA-TECDOC Series No. 838. (IAEA, Vienna, 1995)." id="ref-link-151">50</a></sup> the uncertainties in dose coefficients and concentration factors for cesium in fish and shelf fish are estimated at 10%. Marine food intake rates of radionuclides are estimated to be within 20% (Ref. <a href="#ref51" title="Aarkrog, A. et al. Comparison of doses from 137Cs and 210Po in marine food: a major international study. J. Environ. Radioact. 34, 69-90 (1997)." id="ref-link-152">51</a>). In the Method 2 the dominant contribution to the dose uncertainty may come from the estimation of a radionuclide concentration in seafood. As we did not use in the dose calculations <sup>137</sup>Cs levels below the screening value (100 Bq/kg ww), this approach should be conservative for a general public as seafood with higher radionuclide levels should not be available on the market. The other parameters used in the Method 2 have similar uncertainties as in the Method 1.</p><p>Our approach has been conservative also in the estimation of seafood consumption, as we expected that the marine products are consumed as complete samples. This is correct, e.g. in the case of shellfish, however, in the case of fish only about 50% is really consumed. Also we do not take into account losses due to cooking (e.g. a transfer of radionuclides from meat to non-eatable liquid or oil), which can represent up to about 70% of the total marine product<sup><a href="#ref52" title="International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Modelling of resuspension, seasonality and losses during food processing. IAEA-TECDOC-647. (IAEA, Vienna, 1992)." id="ref-link-153">52</a></sup>. All these factors contributed to the final estimation of uncertainties. If we assume that all the mentioned uncertainties are independent of each other, the total of the estimated uncertainties in the calculations can be worked out to be ~60% for estimates of <sup>137</sup>Cs doses due to the consumption of fish and shellfish using Method 1 (water data) and ~70%, using Method 2 (biota data). The estimated uncertainties are comparable with other dose assessment exercises<sup><a href="#ref50" title="International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Sources of Radioactivity in the Marine Environment and their RelativeContributions to Overall Dose Assessment from Marine Radioactivity. IAEA-TECDOC Series No. 838. (IAEA, Vienna, 1995)." id="ref-link-154">50</a>, <a href="#ref51" title="Aarkrog, A. et al. Comparison of doses from 137Cs and 210Po in marine food: a major international study. J. Environ. Radioact. 34, 69-90 (1997)." id="ref-link-155">51</a></sup>. Our approach has been, however, very conservative, therefore the estimated doses can be considered as the maximum doses delivered to the Japanese and world population from consumption of seafood.</p>
