                     <p id="p-2">The Ross Ice Shelf, a thick, floating tongue of solid ice the size of Spain, is the biggest of the many such barriers that
                        ring Antarctica and keep its ice sheets from sliding into the sea. Yet the shape of the sea floor beneath—a critical factor
                        in how fast the shelf might melt—is virtually unknown. The ice keeps sonar-carrying ships out, and the water beneath it blocks
                        radar. Now, geophysicists at Columbia University“s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York, plan to fill in
                        the giant blank spot, using an ultrasensitive airborne gravity detector. The sensor detects tiny changes in gravity: the boosts
                        caused by the extra mass of seafloor hills and the decreases from troughs. The team plans to crisscross the Ross shelf in
                        36 flights over two 3-week-long campaigns, one in November and a second in 2016. They hope to map features as small as 50
                        meters tall—dramatically better than the present map, which scientists pieced together in the 1970s by setting off small explosions
                        on the ice every 50 kilometers and recording the echoes.
