		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Recently enhanced contrasts in winter (DJF) mean temperatures and extremes (cold southeast and warm northwest) across North America have triggered intensive discussion both within and outside of the scientific community, but the mechanisms responsible for these contrasts remain unresolved. Here we use a combination of observations and reanalysis datasets to show that the strengthened contrasts in winter mean temperatures and extremes across North America are closely related to an enhancement of the positive Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern during the second half of the twentieth century. Recent intensification of positive PNA events is associated with amplified planetary waves over North America, driving cold-air outbreaks into the southeast and warm tropical/subtropical air into the northwest. This not only results in a strengthened winter mean temperature contrast, but increases the occurrence of the opposite-signed extremes in these two regions.</p></div>
