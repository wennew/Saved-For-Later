<p>Thus looking at modeled air temperatures and HadCRUT4 observations isn’t quite an apples-to-apples comparison for the oceans. As it turns out, sea surface temperatures haven’t been warming fast as marine air temperatures, so this comparison introduces a bias that makes the observations look cooler than the model simulations. In reality, the comparisons weren’t quite correct. As <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/robust2015/background.html" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">lead author Kevin Cowtan</a> told me,</p>

<p>When accounting for these factors, the study finds that the difference between observed and modeled temperatures since 1975 is smaller than previously believed. The models had projected a 0.226°C per decade global surface air warming trend for 1975–2014 (and 0.212°C per decade over the geographic area covered by the HadCRUT4 record). However, when matching the HadCRUT4 methods for measuring sea surface temperatures, the modeled trend is reduced to 0.196°C per decade. The observed HadCRUT4 trend is 0.170°C per decade.</p>
<p>So when doing an apples-to-apples comparison, the difference between modeled global temperature simulations and observations is 38% smaller than previous estimates. Additionally, as noted in a <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n3/full/ngeo2105.html" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">2014 paper led by NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt</a>, less energy from the sun has reached the Earth’s surface than anticipated in these model simulations, both because solar activity declined more than expected, and volcanic activity was higher than expected. Ed Hawkins, another co-author of this study, <a href="http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2015/an-apples-to-apples-comparison-of-global-temperatures/" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">wrote about this effect</a>.</p>

<p>As Hawkins notes, the remaining discrepancy between modeled and observed temperatures may come down to climate variability; namely the fact that there has been a preponderance of La Niña events over the past decade, which have a short-term cooling influence on global surface temperatures. When there are more La Niñas, we expect temperatures to fall below the average model projection, and when there are more El Niños, we expect temperatures to be above the projection, as may be the case <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jun/15/the-latest-global-temperature-data-are-breaking-records" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">when 2015 breaks the temperature record</a>.</p>
<p>We can’t predict changes in solar activity, volcanic eruptions, or natural ocean cycles ahead of time. If we want to evaluate the accuracy of long-term global warming model projections, we have to account for the difference between the simulated and observed changes in these factors. When the authors of this study did so, they found that climate models have very accurately projected the observed global surface warming trend.</p>
<p>In other words, as I discussed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Climatology-versus-Pseudoscience-Exposing-Predictions/dp/1440832013" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">my book</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x-0" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">Denial101x</a> lecture, climate models have proven themselves reliable in predicting long-term global surface temperature changes. In fact, even more reliable than I realized.</p>

<p>There’s <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">a common myth</a> that models are unreliable, often based on apples-to-oranges comparisons, like looking at satellite estimates of temperatures higher in the atmosphere versus modeled surface air temperatures. Or, some contrarians like John Christy will <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/21/congress-manufactures-doubt-and-denial-in-climate-change-hearing" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">only consider the temperature high in the atmosphere</a>, where satellite estimates are less reliable, and where people don’t live.</p>
<p>This new study has shown that when we do an apples-to-apples comparison, climate models have done a good job projecting the observed temperatures where humans live. And those models predict that unless we take serious and immediate action to reduce human carbon pollution, global warming will continue to accelerate into dangerous territory.</p>
