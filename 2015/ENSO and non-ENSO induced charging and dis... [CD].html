The process-based similarity between these two modes of tropical Pacific wind stress variability suggests that both can produce a charging/discharging of the equatorial Pacific, however one (the ENSO mode) represents part of the ENSO cycle itself and the other (the TWC mode) represents a separate forcing mechanism of that cycle.</p>","direction":"ltr"}};
