These results are similar to previous findings that the warming is more rapid in China and the Tibetan Plateau than is found globally<sup><a id="ref-link-section-29" title="Ren, G. Y. et al.

At the first stage (1980–1997), the warming amplitude is 0.42 °C decade<sup>−1</sup> in other parts of China, about twice the warming rate over the Tibetan Plateau (0.21 °C decade<sup>−1</sup>). At the second stage (1998–2013), however, the warming rates in other parts of China have an opposite cooling trend (−0.20 °C decade<sup>−1</sup>), while the surface air temperature over the Tibetan Plateau exhibits an accelerated warming trend (0.25 °C decade<sup>−1</sup>), undocumented in previous studies.</p><p>In order to compare the seasonal and regional differences of temperature change over the Tibetan Plateau and other parts of China, <a href="#f2">Fig. 2</a> shows the annual mean and four season air temperature trend for three periods (1980–2013, 1980–1997, and 1998–2013). For the whole period (1980–2013, <a href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>), in terms of annual mean, the Tibetan Plateau and the rest of China have a larger warming amplitude than the global mean (0.16 °C decade<sup>−1</sup>). Meanwhile, similar warming rates are found for four seasons. While the surface air temperature trends of China and the Tibetan Plateau are comparable in spring (March–April–May, MAM) and autumn (September–October–November, SON), and the Tibetan Plateau has a larger warming rate in summer (June–July–August, JJA) and winter (December–January–February, DJF) than other parts of China, making it experiencing a larger warming rate than other parts of China in terms of annual mean temperature. At the first stage (1980–1997, <a href="#f2">Fig. 2b</a>), other parts of China is characterized by a more rapid warming rate than the Tibetan Plateau, and the most significant warming season is winter for other parts of China. At the second stage (1998–2013, <a href="#f2">Fig. 2c</a>), during the global climate warming hiatus, other parts of China experience a remarkable cooling trend in winter and spring, leading to annual mean cooling. In contrast, the warming trend remains over the Tibetan Plateau for all seasons, except autumn. Therefore, in contrast to the slowdown of the global warming or the cooling trend in other parts of China, the Tibetan Plateau has experienced a unique accelerated warming trend since 1998.</p><div class="border-gray-medium border-all-5 standard-space-below pl10 pr10 pt20 pb20 clear" data-container-section="figure"><figure><figcaption><b id="f2" class="block tiny-space-below">Figure 2: The annual and seasonal mean temperature trend over China (blue) and the Tibetan Plateau (TP, red) based on station data in spring (March–April–May, MAM), summer (June–July–August, JJA), autumn (September–October–November, SON), winter (December–January–February, DJF), and annual (ANN).</b></figcaption><div class="small-space-below"><a href="/articles/srep13711/figures/2" class="block small-space-below" data-track="click" data-track-source="image" data-track-dest="link:Figure2"><img src="/article-assets/npg/srep/2015/150902/srep13711/images_hires/m685/srep13711-f2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" class="block max-width"/></a><div class="text12 strong suppress-bottom-margin add-top-margin"><p>Units: °C decade<sup>−1</sup>.

It is clear that the Tibetan Plateau is the most warmed area in all seasons except autumn. In spring, the Tibetan Plateau and the regions to its east at the same latitudes share a similar warming trend, while a cooling trend is detected over northeastern and southeastern China (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3a,b</a>). In summer, most of China, except certain stations over western and northern China, experiences a strong warming trend with a maximum warming rate of 1.97 °C decade<sup>−1</sup> (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3c,d</a>). The temperature changes little in autumn and has an opposite trend to spring; i.e., warming over northeastern and southeastern China but cooling over northern and central China (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3e,f</a>). A sharp temperature trend contrast was found in winter (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3g,h</a>). The strongest warming centre appears over the Tibetan Plateau, while other parts of China have a dramatic cooling trend. The annual air temperature shows a dramatic warming trend over the Tibetan Plateau and cooling trend in other parts of China (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3i,j</a>). As shown in <a href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>, the gridded temperature trend agrees well with the station observed temperature trend.</p><div class="border-gray-medium border-all-5 standard-space-below pl10 pr10 pt20 pb20 clear" data-container-section="figure"><figure><figcaption><b id="f3" class="block tiny-space-below">Figure 3: The distributions of the annual and seasonal mean grid temperature (left column) and station temperature (right column) trend during 1998–2013.</b></figcaption><div class="small-space-below"><a href="/articles/srep13711/figures/3" class="block small-space-below" data-track="click" data-track-source="image" data-track-dest="link:Figure3"><img src="/article-assets/npg/srep/2015/150902/srep13711/images_hires/m685/srep13711-f3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" class="block max-width"/></a><div class="text12 strong suppress-bottom-margin add-top-margin"><p>The dotted areas indicate the trends are significant at 90% confidence level according to a two-tailed Student’s t-test, the same as to the filled circles in the right column.

The warming amplitude over high latitudes is larger than that in low latitudes over the Tibetan Plateau, so the weakening of wind speed leads to reduced heat transfer beyond the Tibetan Plateau; thus more energy remains in the Tibetan Plateau, warming local air. Can this mechanism be used to explain the accelerated warming over the Tibetan Plateau during the second stage? In <a href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a> we plot the temporal variation of the 10 m wind speed over the whole Tibetan Plateau, averaged by stations from 1980–2013, for the four seasons and the annual mean. It is clear that the wind speed features a steady declining trend at the first stage, in accordance with previous findings<sup><a id="ref-link-section-34" title="Yang, K. et al.

Post-1990s, the <i>in situ</i> wind speed recovers gradually, thus the energy concentration cannot explain the accelerated warming trend over the Tibetan Plateau after 1990s. As reported by Duan and Wu<sup><a id="ref-link-section-36" title="Duan, A. M. &amp; Wu, G. X. Changes of cloud amount and the climate warming on the Tibetan Plateau. Geophy. Res. Lett. 33, L22704 (2006)." href="/articles/srep13711#ref30">30</a></sup>, the low-level cloud amount exhibited a significant increasing trend at nighttime during 1961–2003, leading to enhanced nocturnal warming. This factor enhances the warming of the Tibetan Plateau, and the nighttime temperature increase with larger amplitude than daytime temperature, reducing the diurnal temperature range. In <a href="#f4">Fig. 4b</a>, we see that the low-level cloud amount has increased remarkably since 1998, compared with the first stage. Based on the daytime and nighttime station observed low-level cloud data, we find that the low-level cloud amount increases slightly in the day and at night at the first stage (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4c</a>). At the second stage, however, the trend is larger during the nighttime than in daytime during 1998–2009, favouring <i>in situ</i> atmosphere counterradiation enhanced and rapid warming, especially in summer and annual mean. Actually, the nighttime low-level cloud also shows a larger increase trend than daytime cloud in winter during 1998–2008 (0.51 tenths decade<sup>−1</sup>, significant at 95% confidence level, at nighttime compared with 0.29 tenths decade<sup>−1</sup> in the daytime) after the abnormal minimal value removed in 2009. Meanwhile, the sunshine duration over the Tibetan Plateau decreases at the first stage, but it increases at the second stage (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4d</a>), favouring more direct solar radiation absorption during the day.</p><div class="border-gray-medium border-all-5 standard-space-below pl10 pr10 pt20 pb20 clear" data-container-section="figure"><figure><figcaption><b id="f4" class="block tiny-space-below">Figure 4: Temporal evolution of the annual and seasonal mean (a) 10 m wind speed (units: m s<sup>−1</sup>), (b) low-level cloud, (c) low-level cloud in daytime (1980–2009, dash lines, 06-18 local time) and nighttime (solid lines, 18–06 local time), only the trends at the second stage are shown here, and (d) sunshine duration (units: h) over the Tibetan Plateau during 1980–2013.</b></figcaption><div class="small-space-below"><a href="/articles/srep13711/figures/4" class="block small-space-below" data-track="click" data-track-source="image" data-track-dest="link:Figure4"><img src="/article-assets/npg/srep/2015/150902/srep13711/images_hires/m685/srep13711-f4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" class="block max-width"/></a><div class="text12 strong suppress-bottom-margin add-top-margin"><p>The numbers indicate the corresponding trends.

The total cloud decreases dramatically over the southern Tibetan Plateau (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5a,b</a>) and a slightly increases over the northern Tibetan Plateau at nighttime (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5b</a>), resulting the sunshine duration and the daytime surface air temperature increased over the southern Tibetan Plateau, vice versa to the northern Tibetan Plateau (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5e,g</a>) .
