					<h2>Precipitation variations and role of climate phenomena</h2><p>As there is a line of north-south orientated mountains situated on the border of Myanmar and Thailand, precipitation variations are expected to be vary between east side and west side of Dawna Range (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f1">Fig 1(a)</a>). So, monthly standard deviation of precipitation for east side and west side of Dawna Range from 1961 to 2007 is calculated in order to clarify the variations of precipitation in these two domains (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f1">Fig 1(b)</a>). Based on the results, the precipitation varies spatially between east and west of Dawna Range, associated with the varying impact factors. Therefore, east and west of Dawna Range are separated here into two domains, Southern Myanmar Monsoon Domain (hereafter SMMD) and Thailand Monsoon Domain (hereafter TMD), which also include small parts of Laos and Cambodia as the domain has a rectangular shape (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f1">Fig. 1(a)</a>). Northern Myanmar is not included in this study because the precipitation variations in that domain are somewhat different from that of the southern counterpart. For the convenience of comparisons, domain means of the precipitation anomalies in both domains are calculated and later referred to as the Southern Myanmar Index (precipitation anomalies in the domain SMMD) and Thailand Index (precipitation anomalies in the domain TMD).</p><p>The time series of Southern Myanmar Index (SMI, red) and of the Thailand Index (TI, blue) during MAM, JJA, and SON from 1961 to 2007 are shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f2">Figure 2(a), (b), and (c)</a> respectively. A comparison of the two time series reveals that the variation of both indices differs little during MAM, differs somewhat during SON but differs greatly during JJA. The correlation coefficients between them are 0.85 (MAM), 0.26 (JJA) and 0.69 (SON) respectively. The significant value for 95% confidence level by two-tailed Student t-test is 0.29. Therefore, the correlation coefficients for MAM and SON are significant, whereas the correlation coefficient for JJA is insignificant. This suggests that domain SMMD and TMD are influenced by the same factors during MAM, but these factors vary slightly during SON and greatly during JJA.</p>

		<h2>Precipitation variations and monsoon</h2><p>After identifying that tropical climate phenomena are not the main factors influencing SMI and TI during JJA and SON, further analyses were conducted by making composites of extreme SMMD and TMD precipitation seasons to identify the main element causing the precipitation variations. The extreme events are picked when the index value exceeded the value of 1 standard deviation for both SMI and TI respectively. Based on this criterion for SMMD, we have identified eight (six) cases of extreme floods (droughts) during MAM, six (nine) cases of floods (droughts) during JJA, and eight (five) cases of floods (droughts) during SON. Similarly, TMD had six (seven) cases of floods (droughts) during MAM, six (four) cases of floods (droughts) during JJA after removing the IOD years, and ten (seven) cases of floods (droughts) during SON. The number of IOD events captured by the criteria was very few but those added superfluous noise to the composites during JJA because of the nonlinearity in the impacts of positive and negative phases of IOD. Composite plots are drawn using these extreme seasons. In the seasons when the wind patterns are symmetric between floods and droughts, only composite plots of flood cases are shown. But in case the winds are asymmetric for a season, both flood and drought composite plots are shown for the clarity of the discussion between the two extremities. Symmetric here means that the wind anomalies are generally mirror image to each other between flood and drought cases in a particular domain, while asymmetric means that the wind anomalies are not exactly opposite of each other between flood and drought cases.</p><p>The composite analysis clarifies the role of Southeastern Asian Summer Monsoon<sup><a href="#ref5" title="Misra, V. &amp; DiNapoli, S. The variability of the Southeast Asian summer monsoon. Int. J. Climatol. 34, 893-901 (2014)." id="ref-link-12">5</a></sup> in the rainfall variability over SMMD and TMD. However, this role differs between the domains and also among the seasons. For MAM, in addition to the influence of ENSO, the 850 hPa monsoon wind east of Sri Lanka is found to be another factor influencing SMI and TI. Because the wind patterns are symmetric between flood and drought cases, only composites of the flood cases for SMMD and TMD are shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f3">Fig. 3(a) and 3(b)</a>. Based on those plots, it can be deduced that the strengthening of the 850 hPa zonal wind east of Sri Lanka may bring more precipitation to SMMD and TMD. On the contrary, the weakening of the 850 hPa zonal wind east of Sri Lanka may bring less precipitation to SMMD and TMD as those winds in drought events are opposite to that in floods.</p>

	<p>For SMMD during JJA, however, the patterns are more asymmetric. The strengthening of both the 850 hPa westerlies in the northern part of India and the southerlies west of Sumatra bring extra moisture to this region causing more precipitation (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f4">Fig. 4(a)</a>). On the other hand, the weakening of the 850 hPa wind north of Sumatra may cause less precipitation in SMMD (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f4">Fig. 4(b)</a>). During SON, the precipitation of SMMD is influenced by monsoon transition wind east of Sri Lanka (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f5">Fig. 5</a>), that is same as MAM season. <a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f5">Fig. 5</a> shows that the strengthening of the westerlies east of Sri Lanka causes more precipitation in SMMD, and the wind patterns for drought cases are similar to those of flood years. This means the transition phase and the associated conditions of the Southeastern Asian Summer Monsoon play a major role for the precipitation in SMMD during SON season.</p>

	<p>For TMD during JJA, the strengthening of the easterlies east of Hainan Island causes higher than normal precipitation (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f6">Fig. 6</a>) in that domain. It may be noted here that the 850 hPa wind patterns are symmetric between flood and drought cases. This means that the weakening of the easterlies east of Hainan Island causes less precipitation in TMD. However, this situation changes during SON, when the wind patterns become asymmetric between flood and drought cases. Strengthening of the southerlies south of Vietnam will bring more precipitation to TMD (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f7">Fig. 7(a)</a>), whereas weakening of the westerlies will cause less precipitation (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f7">Fig. 7(b)</a>). This means that fast transition of Southeastern Asian Summer Monsoon and the absence of southerlies from equatorial region will cause drought, whereas normal/slow transition with the strengthening of southerlies from the equatorial region will most likely cause floods there.</p>

	<h2>Constructing ICMI and comparing them with IMI and WNPMI</h2><p>The composite analyses clearly show that SMI and TI are influenced by the designated regions of monsoon winds that carry moistures to land. These moistures will cause atmospheric instability over land when the surface air will rise through the moist adiabatic process. The rising air will trigger condensation and cloud formation, and then cause rainfall. Furthermore, these monsoon winds are different from the monsoon winds associated with that of the Indian Monsoon. Therefore, based on monsoon winds that determine the moisture flow to the two study domains, a set of indicators are formulated here to link them to the precipitation variations and possible predictions of those variations. For SMMD, during MAM and SON, the indicators are the westerlies east of Sri Lanka, represented by the 850 hPa zonal wind anomalies in the domain of 85°E–95°E, 7.5°N–12.5°N and constructed as the Indo-China Monsoon Indices Type 1 (ICMI I). The ICMIs (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>) are the domain averages of the zonal, or zonal and meridional wind anomalies of a chosen domain. For SMMD during JJA, since SMI is affected by westerlies from India and southerlies from Sumatra, 72.5°E–85°E, 16.25°N–20°N is chosen as the domain of 850 hPa zonal wind anomalies, and 92.5°E–98.75°E, 2.5°S–10°N is chosen as the domain of 850 hPa meridional wind anomalies. The sum of the domain averages of the zonal wind anomalies and meridional wind anomalies is the ICMI of domain SMMD during JJA, which is called as Indo-China Monsoon Indices Type 2 (ICMI II).</p><p>Since the TMD variation is same as that of the SMMD during MAM, the same monsoon index is applicable to the latter during that season. During JJA, however, TMD is affected by the easterlies east of Hainan Island. So, the domain average of 850 hPa zonal wind anomalies in the domain of 115°E–135°E, 18.75°N–21.25°N are chosen as the ICMI for TMD during JJA, which is Indo-China Monsoon Indices Type 3 (ICMI III; inverted in the analysis). During SON, TMD is affected by both the westerlies east of Sri Lanka and southerlies south of Vietnam. Hence, the domain of 85°E–95°E, 7.5°N–12.5°N is chosen for the 850 hPa zonal wind anomalies and the domain of 106.25°E–108.75°E, 0°–8.75°N is chosen for the 850 hPa meridional wind anomalies. Both domain averaged wind anomalies are also used as the Indo-China Monsoon Indices Type 4 (ICMI IV) for TMD during SON. The domains of all those ICMIs are shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#f8">Figure 8</a>.</p>

	<p>Partial correlation between ICMIs, IMI, and WNPMI with SMI and TI is calculated for the comparison between ICMIs, IMI, and WNPMI (<a href="/srep/2015/150129/srep08107/full/srep08107.html#t1">Table 1</a>). The partial correlation coefficients here are the correlation coefficients that have excluded the influences of Niño 3, EMI and DMI. The partial correlation coefficients between ICMIs with TI and SMI are all equal or above 0.5. Furthermore, the partial correlation coefficients between ICMIs with TI and SMI are higher than those with IMI and WNPMI. This means that ICMIs are more accurate than IMI and WNPMI for indicating the strength of Southeastern Asian Summer Monsoon.</p>
