		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>One-year long, full-depth velocity measurements were used to examine the spatial structure and temporal variability of the zonal flow in the Luzon Strait (LSZF). The observation revealed a renewed mean flow structure: in the upper (&lt; 500 m) and deep (>2000 m) layers, the LSZF was mostly westward; in the intermediate layer (500–2000 m), it was dominated by an eastward flow in the south but a westward flow in the north. The volume transport across the observed section between 19.8° N and 21.2° N exhibited strong seasonal and intra-seasonal variability. On the seasonal time scale, the upper-layer transport showed a clear annual cycle, strongest in January and weakest in June; the intermediate-layer transport also showed a semiannual cycle, attaining its peaks (troughs) in January and June (April and October). On the intra-seasonal time scale, both the upper-layer and intermediate-layer transports showed significant energy peaks at about 60 and 10–30 days. Further analysis indicated that the ~60 day variability might be attributed to the impinging mesoscale eddies from the Pacific, while the 10–30 day variability appeared to obtain its energy from local intra-seasonal wind forcing and baroclinic instability of the background current. The 10–100 day upper-layer and intermediate-layer transport variabilities were highly anti-correlated, suggesting a baroclinic nature of the intra-seasonal variabilities of the LSZF.
