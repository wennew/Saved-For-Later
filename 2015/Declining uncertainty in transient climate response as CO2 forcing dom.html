Here we show, based on data from the two reports, that this evolution towards lower uncertainty can be expected to continue into the future. Because it is easier to reduce air pollution than carbon dioxide emissions and because of the long lifetime of carbon dioxide, the less uncertain carbon dioxide forcing is expected to become increasingly dominant. Using a statistical model, we estimate that the relative uncertainty in anthropogenic forcing of more than 40% quoted in the latest IPCC report for 2011 will be almost halved by 2030, even without better scientific understanding. Absolute forcing uncertainty will also decline for the first time, provided projected decreases in aerosols occur.

													<p>Aerosols, ozone and stratospheric water vapour, well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG), land-use change and total forcing are given for SAR (1750–1993), TAR (1750–1998), AR4 (1750–2005) and AR5 (1750–2011)) and two RCPs for 2030. All the forcing values are based on best estimates reported in the IPCC reports, but with a consistent approach to calculate the total forcing which may differ slightly from reported values (<a href="/ngeo/journal/v8/n3/full/ngeo2371.html#methods">Methods</a>). In SAR land-use change was not estimated and thus not included in the total. Further, the RF of a given CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was estimated to be 15% higher in SAR than in the recent IPCC reports, adding 0.24 W m<sup>−2</sup> to the total RF quoted in SAR. Estimate for AR5 and the two RCPs for 2030 includes rapid adjustments in the RF, whereas these have not been quantified earlier in SAR, TAR and AR4. The probability density function for SAR and TAR are based on Boucher and Haywood<sup><a href="/ngeo/journal/v8/n3/full/ngeo2371.html#ref19" title="Boucher, O. &amp; Haywood, J. On summing the components of radiative forcing of climate change. Clim. Dynam. 18, 297-302 (2001).">19</a></sup> and their simulation C1.5. The relative uncertainties are shown in the right panel. All uncertainty ranges correspond to 5–95% confidence intervals with relative uncertainties given as half the 5–95% relative range.</p>

													<p>Relative (<b>a</b>) and absolute (<b>b</b>) uncertainty in TCR for the indicated conditions as a function of temperature change. The results are based on Monte Carlo simulations of the PDF of TCR as a function of temperature change and relative uncertainty in RF for AR4 and AR5 and for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in 2030 (see <a href="/ngeo/journal/v8/n3/full/ngeo2371.html#methods">Methods</a> for source of RF values). The uncertainties in RF for the two RCPs are based on the scientific knowledge in AR5 and projected abundance changes. Observed temperature changes and their uncertainties from AR4 and AR5 are adopted in the calculations of the relative uncertainty in TCR, whereas for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 results are shown for CMIP5 simulated temperature changes. The absolute uncertainty in temperature change for 2030 is assumed to be same as in AR5. The relative uncertainties and best estimates of TCR are shown as horizontal lines, with ranges shown for lower and upper bound of the relative uncertainty in TCR and TCR (lines for AR4 and AR5, bands for the two RCPs for 2030). The inset shows the TCR and the uncertainty range from equation (1) for temperature changes and RF at the time of AR5, but with different relative uncertainty in RF from AR4, AR5, and RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for 2030. The diamond symbol shows the TCR with the best estimate of RF and is thus constant to illustrate solely the difference in relative uncertainty in RF.</p>
