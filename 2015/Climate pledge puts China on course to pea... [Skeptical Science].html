<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Low-carbon energy</strong></h3>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>China's climate pledge also repeated its existing goals to source 20% of its energy needs from non-fossil sources by 2030, up from 15% in 2020. This would imply roughly maintaining the rate of progress seen since 2011.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>This expansion has been based on a massive build-out of renewables, particularly hydro, with China adding</span> <a href="http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/06/10-charts-showing-why-carbon-emissions-stalled-last-year/"><span>nearly half</span></a> <span>of the additional renewable power generated globally over the past decade. It has targets to raise hydro capacity to 420 gigawatts (GW) in 2020, while adding 18GW of nuclear, doubling wind to 220 GW and doubling solar to 70GW, all between 2015 and 2020.</span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>To achieve these</span> <a href="http://globalchange.mit.edu/CECP/files/document/MITJPSPGC_Rpt267.pdf"><span>ambitions</span></a><span>, China has been investing more in renewable energy than the US, EU and Japan put together. Combined low-carbon power capacity could expand by 800-1,000GW between now and 2030, according to the</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/WRIClimate/status/615892218918928384"><span>World Resources Institute</span></a><span>.</span></p>&#13;
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Paris deal</strong></h3>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>China says it wants a legally binding UN climate deal from Paris that is "balanced and ambitious", guided by the climate convention principles of equity and "common but differentiated responsibilities". This means the agreement should require all parties to limit or reduce emissions during 2020-2030, China says, but with developed countries taking the lead.</span></p>&#13;
<p>It repeats calls on climate finance and technology transfer made jointly with the <a href="http://www.rtcc.org/2015/06/29/india-china-brazil-south-africa-issue-un-climate-deal-checklist/">BASIC group</a> of emerging economies over the weekend. China wants the core Paris agreement to include elements on cutting emissions, adapting to climate change, financing the efforts of poorer nations and transferring low-carbon technologies.</p>&#13;
<p>It says it will establish a Fund for South-South Cooperation on Climate Change to provide "assistance and support, within its means" to other African nations, small island states and other developing countries. This breaks with previous tradition, where developed nations are the only ones that have been obliged to provide climate finance.</p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though China's language on the Paris deal is detailed, it leaves plenty of wriggle room around the details of which parts should be legally binding, on who, and in what way. And in common with all other climate pledges so far, its INDC remains</span> <a href="http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china.html"><span>well short</span></a> <span>of what would be required to meet the agreed 2C target for avoiding dangerous climate change.</span></p>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Liz Gallagher, programme leader on climate diplomacy at thinktank E3G says:</span></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="quoteBackground" dir="ltr"><span>"This submission is critical to building momentum towards a climate deal in Paris. There is still time for China to ramp up ambition.  These offers are the floor, not the ceiling of a deal in Paris."</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the corridors of the</span> <a href="http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/06/in-depth-trust-high-but-progress-slow-at-un-climate-talks/"><span>Bonn climate</span></a> <span>talks in June, there was a sense that, perhaps in contrast to the ill-fated Copenhagen talks in 2009, China is strongly in favour of a deal in Paris. To the extent that it has been playing hardball on some issues, it is more a case of attempting to extract concessions rather than walking away completely.</span></p>&#13;
<p><span><span>So the Chinese pledge is being received as a positive, yet insufficient momentum-building step towards a deal — and just maybe, leaving the door open for 2C.</span></span></p></div></div>
