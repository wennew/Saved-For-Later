                  <p id="p-1">Theoretical physicist Ulf Leonhardt is not afraid to pursue audacious scientific ideas. Leonhardt is best known for his work
                     on how metamaterials—materials engineered to have properties not found in nature—can be used to fashion invisibility devices
                     and how fiber optics can be used to produce analogs of the event horizon, the point of no return in black holes. Last December
                     at the TEDxBrussels conference, <em>Science</em> Careers asked Leonhardt, a professor of physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, to share his thoughts
                     about his research and career. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

                     <p><cite><strong>A:</strong></cite>Be stubborn. Believe in yourself. Don't do what others are saying. Also very important is to stand up again and again. You
                        will fall all the time. There will be disasters, small and great.
                     </p>
                     <p>Each step in my career began with disasters. I studied for 1 year at Moscow State University to become a specialist in high-energy
                        physics. I didn't really like that, so I started over. I then did my master's degree in half a year, so I almost caught up.
                        For my Ph.D., which I did in the former East Germany, I started a project in the atomic physics of hot, dense plasmas. I worked
                        for 2 years in this subject, but then I decided to start again. So, instead, I did a Ph.D. in quantum optics in one of the
                        newly founded Max Planck Research Groups. I did the Ph.D. in 1 year and 3 months, so at the end I was really on time for a
                        Ph.D., even though I had failed the initial phase.
                     </p>
                     <p>And so it went, on and on. Usually the first attempt fails, but you learn from it. Maybe you don't even learn all the time,
                        but from the beginning, you should not be afraid of failure.

                     <p><cite><strong>A:</strong></cite>I had fellowships until the point when I got a full professorship, so I never went through the hurdles of a tenure-track or
                        lecturer position. This keeps you independent and active, and you're not forced to adjust to the academic system at an earlier
                        stage. For theorists, I think this is an approach that people should think about.

                     <p><cite><strong>A:</strong></cite>This is not really what happens. I've always felt that if I have an idea, it's going to work. Only when it fails do I realize
                        that it doesn't. Then comes, usually, a long period of desperation, but the idea is lingering. Then suddenly a possible solution
                        comes to mind.
                     </p>
                     <p>It's not that you think it's crazy at first. You may think that there is a chance that it works, and it may not completely
                        work, but you should always believe in it. It's surprising if something works the first time—usually it doesn't—so then you
                        need to be persistent and try to correct it to make it work.

                        and then I respond and I learn from it.

                     <p><cite><strong>A:</strong></cite>What I have observed in some very good young scientists is that they think too much about their careers. This is all wrong:
                        Build yourself, not your CV. Otherwise, you succeed in the short term, but then you may burn out and lose the fun in science.
                        Young scientists should first think about what they want to do. Know how science and the scientific establishment works, but
                        don't take it too seriously. Listen to what other people are saying, but don't apply it automatically. Other people may see
                        some aspects of your situation, but they don't have the knowledge of it all. Only you have that.
