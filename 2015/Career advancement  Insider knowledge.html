 <p>When Andrew Hires looks back on his days as a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher, he wishes that somebody had told him how unpredictable science can be. “You do experiments, and 90% of them aren't going to work. Nobody warned me about that,” says Hires, a neurobiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He had to adjust his expectations, double down on perseverance and savour the successes when they came.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>      <div class="illustration illustration-center">

 <p>On the way from the first failed experiment to a tenured or tenure-track position at a major research institution, scientists who intend to remain in academia must learn about a lot more than just frogs, or photons, or whatever they are investigating — they must also accumulate hard-won lessons about publication, funding, promotions and a host of other subjects. Academic scientists who have already gone through the wringer have much to tell newcomers, but are likely to do so only if young scientists can put aside any ill-placed discomfort and ask. “They get plenty of guidance in the field and in the lab,” says Andrew Hendry, a newly tenured ecologist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. But when it comes to the rest of the science life, he says, junior researchers are often stumbling in the dark, or at least walking slowly in a poorly lit room. “People don't ask enough questions. They're embarrassed,” he says.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>

 <p>It is crucial, experienced scientists say, that junior researchers ask questions of their mentors, supervisors, lab and department heads, senior colleagues and members of their network. The answers can add up to a handy guide for navigating up the ladder.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>

 <p>Clara Nellist, a particle-physics postdoc at the Linear Accelerator Laboratory in Orsay, France, wishes that she had known how hard it is to stand out when working in large collaborations. And she would have liked to have known in advance how to turn all the meetings she is expected to attend into an advantage. Earlier this year, she co-authored an important paper that estimated the mass of the long-sought Higgs boson (<a id="n1" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.191803"><span class="vcard author"><span class="fn">G.

 <p>That combination of practical and theoretical physics should give her an edge in the job market, she says, although it doubles the number of meetings that she needs to attend. Many, many meetings — another surprise of the particle-physics world. “CERN knew that meetings were a problem, so they formed a committee to address it. The first thing the committee did was call a meeting,” she says.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>

 <p>Still, those meetings have given her a chance to add her voice to the field and to learn a few things in the process. At first, she was reluctant to speak up. “I would have questions, but I wouldn't ask them in front of an audience. I didn't want to admit to any gaps in my knowledge,” she says. An adviser finally pulled her aside to share one of the important life lessons of science: ask questions. “It shows that you're interested in the topic,” she says.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>      <div class="illustration illustration-center">

 <p>Chenjie Wang, a condensed-matter physics postdoc at the University of Chicago in Illinois, had even more trouble finding his voice. He managed to get his PhD without speaking to anyone other than his adviser. The language barrier was a problem, he says — Wang emigrated from China in 2007. But, more fundamentally, he had yet to appreciate how much other students would have to offer. “I had been told that Americans weren't very strong in maths and physics,” he says with a laugh.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>

 <p>He now sees that silence as a missed opportunity. Conversations around the labs at Chicago have given him a new outlook on science, and perhaps even a better understanding of maths. “Americans are wild thinkers, and they keep chasing answers,” he says. Where he might be content with a single solution, other researchers would continue to approach a problem from different angles, leading to new questions and possibilities. “It's very important to talk to people,” he says. “It will keep your mind open.”</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>

 <p>It didn't help that her postdoc meant taking on a new project in a new lab, even a new city. “I didn't even know where the pipettes were,” she says. She soon found the pipettes, and, after a while, she found some like-minded people. She joined the board of Women in Science at Yale, and reached out to faculty members, postdocs and graduate students who might be open to collaboration. “That has made me feel more like I am part of a research community,” she says.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>

 <p>Hoping to help junior researchers to avoid some common pitfalls and missteps, Hendry has written a 10-part (and counting) series of posts on his popular Eco–Evo Evo–Eco blog (see <a href="#bx1">'How to get ahead'</a>). He drew on personal experience for a post on how to choose a journal. At the time, he had been involved in 45 manuscripts that were submitted to top-tier journals, and had just one accepted. As he notes in his blog, “rejection is an ever present companion in science”.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>      <div class="figure fig-box box-internal cleared" id="bx1">

              <p>Junior researchers tend to have many questions about science — so many that they do not always know what to ask. Andrew Hendry, an ecologist at McGill University in Montreal, has tried to fill in those knowledge gaps with a series of 'how to' posts at his popular Eco–Evo Evo–Eco blog (</p>
<p><a href="http://ecoevoevoeco.blogspot.ca" class="weblink">ecoevoevoeco.blogspot.ca</a></p>
<p>). Topics include 'how to do statistics' and 'how to respond to reviewers'. Here are some highlights.</p>
<ul id="l1" class="bullet">
<li>Don't throw out your data just because they don't seem to fit a particular statistical model. “The data are the real thing,” he says. “The stats are just a tool to aid in interpretation.”</li>
<li>For maximum citations, he advises, don't be afraid to submit a good study to a top-tier journal, even if rejection seems likely. The challenge will inspire you to make the paper as solid as possible, and the reviews might sharpen it even more. This route does entail more time and stress, but the potential payoff is greater.</li>
<li>Beware the 'grass-is-greener' syndrome. It can be tempting to give up a messy, complicated project for a venture that seems clear-cut and straightforward. But the new project is bound to have problems, too. “A given project always looks best before the actual work starts,” he says.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, he says, finish what you start, and publish what you finish.</li></ul>

 <p>Too many proposals and papers lack a sense of purpose, he says. His advice: every piece of scientific writing should employ the 'baby–werewolf–silver-bullet formula'. In other words, the work should have a clear problem (the werewolf), a definitive solution (the silver bullet) and a strong sense of the stakes (the baby). “There has to be something we all care about,” he says.</p> <p class="clear"> </p></div>

 <p>Hires wishes that he had known more about when to publish, not just what. As a graduate student, he created a sensor that measures the release of glutamate in brain cells.

 <p>He recovered from that misstep and was in time offered a tenured position. But he had yet to learn the art of negotiation. “When I got the call, they asked me what kind of salary I wanted.

 <p>Meghan Duffy, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, is a self-assured, widely acclaimed authority on aquatic ecology. But as a graduate student, she had many of the same doubts that plague other young researchers. Was she really cut out for this business?

 <p>So getting ahead in science is easier than many people think. Junior researchers often try to work things out for themselves, but if they seek out advice, they will find that people are willing and eager to share what it takes to succeed.
