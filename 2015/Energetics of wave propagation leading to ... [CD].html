The cold events observed in tropical latitudes are associated with a single Rossby wave pattern propagating over the Pacific Ocean which drives the low level anticyclone from the southwest of the continent to low latitudes. This propagation involves a southern circulation due to the meridional wind penetration and consequently cold air advection causing temperatures to drop below 0 °C. During cool events a subtropical wave train propagating through the Pacific Ocean is observed, which merges before the event with a wave coming from the subpolar latitudes of the South Atlantic Ocean. The zonal propagation leads to the entrance of the anticyclone from the west of the continent, and it is strengthened together with the meridionaly extended cyclone located upstream.

The energetics shows that the cold events kinetic energy maxima are more intense than those of cool events.
