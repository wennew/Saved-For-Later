		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of inter-annual climate variability with worldwide impacts. The knowledge of ENSO drivers and the underlying mechanisms is crucial to improve ENSO prediction, which still remains a challenge. The recently discovered connection between an Atlantic Niño (Niña) and a Pacific Niña (Niño), through an air-sea coupled mechanism during the first and last decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, highlights an opportunity for ENSO prediction. Here, a statistical cross-validated hindcast of ENSO along the 20<sup>th</sup> century is presented, considering the Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures as the unique predictor field, and a set of atmospheric and oceanic variables related to the Atlantic-Pacific connection as the predictand field. The observed ENSO phase is well reproduced and the skill is enhanced at the beginning and the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Understanding this multidecadal modulation of the Atlantic-Pacific connection could help to improve seasonal-to-decadal forecasts of ENSO and its associated impacts.</p></div>
