Its focus is on integrating climate and non-climate information in order to enhance the decision-making process in a wide range of climate-sensitive sectors of society, the economy and the environment.

Data rescue and climate database construction, hurricanes and droughts as examples of extreme climate events and seasonal climate forecasting are focused on in this report and are privileged over other topics because of either their fundamental importance for establishing event probability or scale of societal impact.

                  <p id="p-1">Climate risk management has emerged over the last decade as a distinct area of activity within the wider field of climatology.
                     Its focus is on integrating climate and non-climate information in order to enhance the decision-making process in a wide
                     range of climate-sensitive sectors of society, the economy and the environment. Given the burgeoning pure and applied climate
                     science literature that addresses a range of climate risks, the purpose of this progress report is to provide an overview
                     of recent developments in the field of climatology that may contribute to the risk assessment component of climate risk management.
                     Data rescue and climate database construction, hurricanes and droughts as examples of extreme climate events and seasonal
                     climate forecasting are focused on in this report and are privileged over other topics because of either their fundamental
                     importance for establishing event probability or scale of societal impact. The review of the literature finds that historical

                     the causes and the characterization of hurricanes and droughts stand to benefit the management of these two extreme events
                     while work focused on unravelling the nature of ocean–atmosphere interactions and associated climate anomalies at the seasonal

                     not be automatically assumed by the climatological community.
