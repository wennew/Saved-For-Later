					<h2>Screening for diagenesis</h2><p>The fossil <i>D. strigosa</i> coral (BON-5-D) was screened for potential diagenetic alteration of its skeleton using X-radiography, powder X-ray diffraction, thin-section petrography and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. X-radiography reveals a well-preserved skeleton, a clear pattern of alternating bands of high and low skeletal density and continuous upward growth at a rate of 0.68±0.15 cm per year (±1 s.d.) (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms7159/full/ncomms7159.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>), similar to the annual density-band pairs and growth rates reported for Holocene <i>D. strigosa</i> corals from Bonaire<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Giry, C. et al.

This age model is corroborated by the skeletal pattern of annual density-band pairs as revealed by X-radiographs. For the construction of the chronology, annual Sr/Ca maxima were set to February/March (on average the coolest months) and annual Sr/Ca minima to September/October (on average the warmest months) using the present-day SST climatology<sup><a href="#ref26" title="Smith, T.

The resulting records were interpolated to monthly resolution. The methodology is similar as described for our Holocene Bonaire coral records<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Giry, C. et al.

We note that the shift in the mean coral Sr/Ca and δ<sup>18</sup>O that occurs between years 7 and 8 of the internal chronology (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms7159/full/ncomms7159.html#f2">Fig. 2a,b</a>) is not related to a change of the microsampling transect nor to any shifts in extension rate or coral δ<sup>13</sup>C and, consequently, likely reflects a climatic shift. Importantly, this shift does not affect the amplitude of our SST seasonality calculations described below.</p><h2>Coral seasonality</h2><p>Coral Sr/Ca (δ<sup>18</sup>O) seasonality was calculated following established methods<sup><a href="#ref10" title="Felis, T. et al. Increased seasonality in Middle East temperatures during the last interglacial period. Nature 429, 164–168 (2004)." id="ref-link-129">10</a></sup> and similar to our Holocene Bonaire coral study<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Giry, C. et al.

Seasonality is calculated as the difference between the maximum and the minimum monthly coral Sr/Ca (δ<sup>18</sup>O) value of a given year. The mean seasonality is calculated by averaging the seasonality of all years of a given coral record. The uncertainty assigned to each coral-SST seasonality estimate for a given snapshot is ±1 s.e. (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150122/ncomms7159/full/ncomms7159.html#f2">Fig. 2e,f</a>).

Fixed modern distributions of continental ice sheets (except for the experiment with reduced Greenland ice sheet), sea level and distribution of land were used throughout the simulations. For the transient simulations, orbital acceleration<sup><a href="#ref60" title="Lorenz, S. J. &amp; Lohmann, G.

Throughout the last interglacial transient simulation, the greenhouse gas concentrations varied according to the values specified by PMIP3 (refs <a href="#ref61" title="Lüthi, D. et al.

In accordance with PMIP3, both the spin-up and the transient simulation were performed with fixed pre-industrial vegetation.</p><p>In addition, a freshwater perturbation experiment based on the last interglacial transient simulation was performed with an identical set-up, by distributing a freshwater flux anomaly (0.02 Sv) over the North Atlantic Ocean (45° W–20° W, 40° N–55° N) that starts at 119.25 kyr ago and ends 117.76 kyr ago, representing 1,500 calendar years (150 model years). This time interval was chosen in order to have the last 500 calendar years (50 model years) of the freshwater perturbation centred at 118.00 kyr ago. The transient simulation then continues from 117.75 to 115.0 kyr ago without freshwater forcing.</p><p>Moreover, a last interglacial transient simulation with reduced Greenland ice sheet was performed. The simulation starts from a quasi-equilibrated time slice run for 130 kyr ago that was spun up for 1,500 years, which has previously been analysed in a sensitivity study on the influence of the Greenland ice sheet on last interglacial climate<sup><a href="#ref64" title="Pfeiffer, M. &amp; Lohmann, G. inEarth System Science: Bridging the Gaps between Disciplines SpringerBriefs in Earth System Sciences eds Lohmann G.et al. 57–64Springer (2013)." id="ref-link-159">64</a></sup>. Throughout the spin-up and last interglacial transient simulations with reduced Greenland ice sheet, the greenhouse gas boundary conditions were fixed to pre-industrial values: 278 ppmv for CO<sub>2</sub>, 650 ppbv for CH<sub>4</sub> and 270 ppbv for N<sub>2</sub>O. In the simulations, the Greenland ice-sheet elevation was reduced by subtracting 1,300 m from each grid point over Greenland. Areas where the present elevation is lower than 1,300 m were defined as ice-free and the albedo was adjusted accordingly. The spin-up and the transient simulation were performed with dynamic vegetation.</p><p>The Holocene transient simulation has previously been analysed in terms of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds evolution<sup><a href="#ref65" title="Varma, V. et al. Holocene evolution of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds in transient simulations with global climate models. Clim. Past 8, 391–402 (2012)." id="ref-link-160">65</a></sup>. The Holocene transient simulation starts from a quasi-equilibrated time slice run for 8.1 kyr ago, using greenhouse gas concentrations at pre-industrial levels: 278 ppmv for CO<sub>2</sub>, 650 ppbv for CH<sub>4</sub> and 270 ppbv for N<sub>2</sub>O. Throughout the Holocene transient simulation the greenhouse gas concentrations were fixed.
