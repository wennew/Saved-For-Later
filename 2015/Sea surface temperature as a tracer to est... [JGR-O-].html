This leads to large uncertainties to the flushing time derived from them and to the evaluation of ecosystem resilience to terrestrially-derived pollution. In fact, numerical hydrodynamic models and analytical cross-shore diffusion models have predicted very different flushing times for the GBR lagoon.
