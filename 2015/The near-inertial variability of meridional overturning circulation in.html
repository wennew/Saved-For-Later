Xiao, D. Wang, Q. Xie, Y. Shu, C. Liu, and J. Chen<br><br>The near-inertial variability of the meridional overturning circulation in
the South China Sea (SCSMOC) has been analyzed based on a global
1/12° ocean reanalysis. The wavelet analysis and power spectrum of
deep SCSMOC time series shows that there is a significant signal in the
near-inertial band. The maximum amplitude of the near-inertial signal in the
SCSMOC is nearly 4 Sv. The spatial structure of the signal features regularly
alternating counterclockwise and clockwise overturning cells. It is also
found that the near-inertial signal of SCSMOC mainly originates from the
Luzon Strait and propagates equatorward with the speed of 1–3 m s<sup>−1</sup>. Further
analyses suggest that the near-inertial signal in the SCSMOC is triggered by
high-frequency wind variability near the Luzon Strait where geostrophic
shear always exists due to Kuroshio intrusion.
