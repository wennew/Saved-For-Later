		<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div><p>Across the western United States, seasonal-scale El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections have been extensively described. Less attention has been paid to spatial and temporal details of these relationships that might be particularly important to managers and decision makers. Here, we explore intra-seasonal relationships between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and average temperature, wet-day temperature, overall precipitation amount, precipitation frequency, and rain/snow partitioning at 138 Global Historical Climatology Network weather stations across the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Results of this study indicate that ENSO influences were generally more pronounced along the coast and in the northern Idaho/western Montana region than in the lee of the Cascades. There was a distinct seasonality in response, with stronger correlations in the late winter (February–March) than in the autumn (October–November) or mid-winter (December–January). The fraction of stations demonstrating correlations to SOI has changed over time, with a trend towards greater spring teleconnections in recent decades.</p></div>
