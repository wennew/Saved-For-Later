		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Tidal mixing in the Indonesian Archipelago contributes to regulation of the tropical atmospheric circulation and water-mass transformation in the Indonesian Throughflow. The present study quantifies the vertical diffusivity in the Indonesian Archipelago by driving a high-resolution three-dimensional numerical model and investigates the processes of internal tide generation, propagation, and dissipation. The numerical experiment shows that <img alt="inline image" src="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2014JC010592/asset/equation/jgrc21211-math-0001.png?v=1&amp;t=ia053pel&amp;s=9a6f50d7a95aa28ac3e4c9aecd615052a2b6fa34"> internal tides are effectively generated over prominent subsurface ridges.
