		<h3>Abstract</h3><div><p>The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is the leading mode of variation in the northern hemisphere winter circulation. Despite its importance for winter temperatures, seasonal forecast models typically suggest that its predictability is low. Nonetheless, we show that an operational forecast model has high skill in predicting the AO, with a correlation of 0.61 for the period of 1981–2010.
