		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The air-sea drag during typhoon landfalls is investigated for a 10-m wind speed as high as <em>U</em><sub>10</sub> ≈ 42 m s<sup>-1</sup>, based on multi-level wind measurements from a coastal tower located in the South China Sea. The drag coefficient (<em>C<sub>D</sub></em>) plotted against the typhoon wind speed is similar to that of open ocean conditions; however, the <em>C<sub>D</sub></em> curve shifts toward a regime of lower winds, and <em>C<sub>D</sub></em> increases by a factor of approximately 0.5 relative to the open ocean. Our results indicate that the critical wind speed at which <em>C<sub>D</sub></em> peaks is approximately 24 m s<sup>-1</sup>, which is 5-15 m s<sup>-1</sup> lower than that from deep water. Shoaling effects are invoked to explain the findings. Based on our results, the proposed <em>C<sub>D</sub></em> formulation, which depends on both water depth and wind speed, is applied to a typhoon forecast model. The forecasts of typhoon track and surface wind speed are improved. Therefore, a water-depth-dependence formulation of <em>C<sub>D</sub> </em>may be particularly pertinent for parameterizing air-sea momentum exchanges over shallow water.
