					<h2>Sampling</h2><p>Field observations were carried out during the Malaspina circumnavigation expedition in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans between December 2010 and July 2011 on board R/V <i>Hespérides</i> (see <a href="/ncomms/2015/150909/ncomms9002/full/ncomms9002.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>). The cruise was divided into seven legs: leg 1 (14 December 2010, Cádiz–13 January 2011, Rio de Janeiro), leg 2 (17 January, Rio de Janeiro–6 February, Cape Town), leg 3 (11 February, Cape Town–13 March, Perth), leg 4 (17 March, Perth–30 March, Sydney), leg 5 (16 April, Auckland–8 May, Honolulu), leg 6 (13 May, Honolulu–10 June, Cartagena de Indias) and leg 7 (19 June, Cartagena de Indias–14 July, Cartagena). Leg 1 crossed the NASE, NATR, WTRA and SATL biogeographical provinces<sup><a href="#ref14" title="Longhurst, A. R. Ecological Geography of the Sea 2nd edn. Academic Press (2006)." id="ref-link-69">14</a></sup>. Leg 2 sampled a zonal transect across the SATL province, the last station being carried out in the Benguela Current Coastal (BENG). Leg 3 crossed the Indian ocean from west to east. The first three stations were carried out in the East Africa Coastal (EARF) province, whereas most of the stations sampled the ISSG province. Four provinces were sampled along the south Australian coast during leg 4: ISSG, AUSW, SSTC and AUSE provinces. During leg 5, the SPSG, PEQD, PNEC and NPTG provinces were sampled. Leg 6 crossed the NPTG and again the PNEC province. Finally, during leg 7 the CARB, NATR and NASE provinces were sampled.</p><p>CTD casts were carried out with a SBE911plus (Sea-Bird Electronics) probe attached to a rosette equipped with Niskin bottles. A Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP) system was also mounted on the rosette. A microstructure turbulence profiler was deployed in 36 stations. Water from Niskin bottles was collected in 39 stations for nutrient analysis, in 44 stations for the determination of N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates and in 136 stations for microphytoplankton abundance determination. Samples for the determination of <i>Trichodesmium</i> abundance from a plankton net were collected in 132 stations.</p><h2>Microstructure measurements</h2><p>Measurements of microstructure shear and temperature used to infer dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy (<i><span class="mb">ε</span></i>) and thermal variance (<i>χ</i>) were conducted by using a microstructure turbulence profiler MSS<sup><a href="#ref38" title="Prandke, H. &amp; Stips, A.

, where <i>p</i><sub>sf</sub> is the weighting factor, corresponding to the fraction of bins where salt fingers are active. Favourable stratification for salt fingers was identified using the density ratio (<i>R</i><sub><i>ρ</i></sub><span class="mb">=</span><i><span class="mb">α</span></i>∂<sub><i>z</i></sub><i>T</i>/<i>β</i>∂<sub><i>z</i></sub><i>S</i>, where <i><span class="mb">α</span></i> and <i>β</i> are the thermal expansion and salinity contraction coefficients, respectively). Although salt fingers are theoretically possible for <i>R</i><sub><i>ρ</i></sub>&gt;1, its contribution to mixing has been shown to be irrelevant for <i>R</i><sub><i>ρ</i></sub>&gt;2 (ref. <a href="#ref12" title="Laurent, L.

According to McDougall<sup><a href="#ref39" title="McDougall, T. J. Some implications of ocean mixing for ocean modelling. Elsevier. Oceanogr. Ser. 46, 21-35 (1988)." id="ref-link-73">39</a></sup> and Hamilton <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref11" title="Hamilton, J. M., Lewis, M. R. &amp; Ruddick, B. R.

Hence, we used two parameters to identify salt finger active bins: the density ratio (1&lt;<i>R</i><sub><i>ρ</i></sub>&lt;2) and the observed mixing efficiency (Γ<sub>Obs</sub>&gt;0.2) (calculated as Γ<sub>Obs</sub><span class="mb">=</span>0.5<i>N</i><sup>2</sup><i>χ</i>/<i><span class="mb">ε</span></i>(∂<sub><i>z</i></sub><i>T</i>)<sup>2</sup>, where <i>N</i> is the buoyancy frequency).

. Errors in turbulence plus salt fingers (<i>K</i><sub>t<span class="mb">+</span>sf</sub>) and salt fingers diffusivity (<i>K</i><sub>sf</sub>) were estimated as the standard deviation of 1,000 estimates obtained by bootstraping the input variables: <i><span class="mb">α</span></i>, <i>β</i>, <i>R</i><sub><i>ρ</i></sub>, <i>K</i><sub><i><span class="mb">ε</span></i></sub> and <i>K</i><sub><i>χ</i></sub>. In this way, <i><span class="mb">ε</span></i> and <i>χ</i> uncertainties were treated implicitly through <i>K</i><sub><i><span class="mb">ε</span></i></sub> and <i>K</i><sub><i>χ</i></sub>. A 10<span class="mb">%</span> error estimate of the salt fingers flux ratio was added to the calculations. A sensitivity test was performed to verify that the computed diffusivity was not strongly dependent on the choice of the critical Γ value (data not shown).</p><p>During leg 3, when we sampled the Indian Ocean, and due to technical problems, no microstructure measurements were available, so diffusivity was estimated by using an adaptation of the KPP<sup><a href="#ref35" title="Large, W.

Uncertainties of KPP diffusivity were calculated as the standard deviation of 1,000 averaged estimates resulting from bootstraping individual 10-m vertical resolution <i>K</i> values within the nitracline.

They were immediately analysed on board according to classical methods using the automated colorimetric technique<sup><a href="#ref42" title="Grasshoff, K. M. &amp; Kremling, K. Methods of Seawater Analysis Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH (1983)." id="ref-link-81">42</a></sup> on a segmented flow Skalar autoanalyser. For the nitracline region, relevant for this study, vertical resolution varied between 20 and 50<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>m. The nitracline was determined as a region of approximately maximum and constant gradient, usually extending to 50–100<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>m and including 4–6 nitrate data points. In those stations where nitrate concentrations were not available (see <a href="/ncomms/2015/150909/ncomms9002/full/ncomms9002.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>) nitrate gradients were computed from the data included in the World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA09) database<sup><a href="#ref43" title="Garcia, H.

A good correspondence between nitrate gradients based on Malaspina observations and the WOA09 climatology was found (<i>r</i><span class="mb">=</span>0.76, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001, data not shown). Diffusive flux errors were calculated as the squared sum of the diffusivity error (see above) and the error of the slope resulting from the linear fit.</p><p>Nitrate diffusive fluxes due to mechanical turbulence and salt finger mixing during the <i>TRYNITROP</i> cruise, which sampled a meridional transect from 30°S to 30°N in the Atlantic Ocean in April–May 2008 (ref. <a href="#ref3" title="Mourino Carballido, B. et al. Importance of N2 fixation versus nitrate eddy diffusion across the Atlantic Ocean. Limnol. Oceanogr. 56, 999-1007 (2011)." id="ref-link-83">3</a>), were calculated following exactly the same protocol as described for the Malaspina expedition.</p><h2>N<sub>2</sub> fixation</h2><p>Samples for the determination of N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates were collected at the same stations where nitrate diffusive fluxes were computed. Additionally, samples were also collected at one station located at the Indian Australia coast (AUSW). Only those stations located in tropical and subtropical regions were used for computed global open-ocean averages reported in the text. N<sub>2</sub> fixation was measured at four depths (surface, the depths where the photosynthetically active radiation was 20 and 10<span class="mb">%</span> of the surface value, and the deep chlorophyll maximum) following the <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> uptake technique described by Montoya <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref15" title="Montoya, J.

For each depth, one (three during leg 6) acid-washed, clear polycarbonate bottle (4<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>l in volume) was filled directly from the CTD rosette and supplemented with 8<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>ml of <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> (98 atom<span class="mb">%</span>; Sigma-Aldrich, lot -CX0937).
