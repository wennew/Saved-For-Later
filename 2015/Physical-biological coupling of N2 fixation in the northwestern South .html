		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Here, we present the first combined results of N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates (<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> assay), dissolved iron (dFe, &lt; 0.2 μm), and primary production (PP) (<sup>14</sup>C assay) in the northwestern South China Sea (NWSCS) coastal upwelling region during summer. Surface N<sub>2</sub> fixation rate ranged between 0.1 nmol N L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> and 5.6 nmol N L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> (average 1.0 nmol N L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>, <em>n</em> = 50) under nonbloom conditions. At a <em>Trichodesmium</em> bloom station, N<sub>2</sub> fixation rate was ∼ 3 orders of magnitude higher. Depth-integrated N<sub>2</sub> fixation rate ranged between 7.5 μmol N m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>and 163.1 μmol N m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> (average 46.4 μmol N m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>). Our results indicate that N<sub>2</sub> fixation is unlikely limited by Fe availability in the NWSCS continental waters, instead, the coastal upwelling-induced combined effects of physical and biological processes may have played a decisive role. With the upwelled cold, dFe-rich, nutrient-replete waters, nondiazotrophic phytoplankton growth would be preferentially enhanced while N<sub>2</sub> fixation was hindered due to relative deficiency of phosphate caused by massive phytoplankton utilization in the coastal upwelling. By comparison, N<sub>2</sub> fixation was notably elevated along with decreased PP in the offshore waters, probably due to a shift from P-deficiency to N-deficiency. Consistently, the contribution of N<sub>2</sub> fixation to PP (0.01–2.52%) also increased toward the open waters. As a significant external N source, summertime N<sub>2</sub> fixation is estimated to contribute a flux of 1.4 Gmol N to this area under nonbloom conditions. This study adds to the knowledge of N<sub>2</sub> fixation in the rarely studied subtropical coastal upwellings, and highlights the necessity of future comprehensive studies in such highly dynamic environments.</p></div>
