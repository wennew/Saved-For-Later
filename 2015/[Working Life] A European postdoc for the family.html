                  <p id="p-1">In the spring of 2011, I started a 2-year Whitaker International postdoctoral scholarship in bioengineering. My husband, an
                     experienced mechanical engineer who is fluent in German, left his job in the United States and found a new one in Vienna.
                     The next year, I learned I was pregnant. We didn't go to Europe to start a family—our goal was to experience a new culture
                     and remain competitive in our fields—but we recognized almost immediately the advantages of Austria's support for young professionals
                     pursuing careers and a family.

                        <p id="p-2" class="first-child"><strong><em>“The parental-leave advantages that Europe can offer postdocs are worth considering.”</em></strong></p>

                  <p id="p-3">Austria is far ahead of the United States in providing options for both women <em>and</em> men to take time off from work for birth and child care. First there is <em>Mutterschutz</em>, a mandatory paid maternity leave and job protection period of 8 weeks before and 8 weeks after the birth of a child. Then
                     there is <em>Elternkarenz</em>, up to 36 months of financial support with allowances of as much as 80% of your monthly wage. Parents frequently opt for
                     14 months, with the father taking 2 months.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-4">Other European countries offer similar benefits. Dutch employment law, for example, entitles working women to 16 weeks of
                     paid <em>zwangerschapsverlof</em>, men to 2 days of paid <em>vaderschapsverlof</em>, and both parents to 6 months of additional unpaid leave with job protection. In the United Kingdom, statutory maternity
                     pay (SMP) is granted for up to 39 weeks, and employers often supplement these benefits with occupational maternity pay. Under
                     the SMP program, fathers can receive 2 weeks of paid leave, with an additional 26 weeks if the mother returns to work. Specific
                     restrictions vary, but non-E.U. nationals can qualify as long as they have an employment contract and an appropriate visa.
                     A science Ph.D. makes it easier to secure the required credentials.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-5">According to a Pew Research Center report covering 38 countries around the world, the United States is the only one that does
                     not mandate paid leave for new mothers. California is one of a few states to offer paid family leave, available to workers
                     who have contributed to the state disability insurance program. But in most of the country, the postdoc parenting experience
                     is institution dependent.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-6">After our son was born, I took 5 months off and my husband took 3 months. We wanted to share parenting responsibilities equally,
                     as much as nature allowed. He planned to take off 5 months, too, but job opportunities in the United States brought us back
                     sooner than expected. Still, my husband was able to experience caring for our son full time while I worked; they bonded in
                     a way that is hardly possible for working fathers in the United States, where paid paternity leave is rare. Being the primary
                     caregiver for 3 months allowed my husband time to find his own way of parenting while I got back to work.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-7">I wanted to stay connected during my leave, so I worked remotely when I could and often brought my son to lab meetings, which
                     my colleagues were kind enough to schedule around naps. My immediate team of male colleagues did not seem to mind the infant
                     intrusion—it helped that he was a calm baby—and meetings were productive. This flexibility, and the absence of pressure to
                     return to work, allowed ample time to connect with my son as I learned to be a mom. Work was secondary when it needed to be.
                  </p>
                  <p id="p-8">In the United States, the pool of qualified postdocs has grown and postdocs have gotten longer. There's now a greater likelihood
                     than ever that training will overlap with starting a family. The decision when and where to have children is personal and
                     depends on many factors; there's something to be said, for example, for having your mother nearby. But in deciding where to
                     train, postdocs should consider the whole experience of working and living, not just time spent in the lab. Add to the mix
                     Europe's ample opportunities for professional enrichment, and the parental-leave advantages that Europe can offer postdocs
                     are worth considering.
