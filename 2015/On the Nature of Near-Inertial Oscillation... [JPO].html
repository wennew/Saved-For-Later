On the non-traditional <i>f</i>-plane due to the horizontal component of the Earth rotation for waves of inertial band with frequencies slightly below the local inertial frequency <i>f</i> there is a waveguide in the mixed layer confined from below by the pycnocline. We argue that when the stratification is shallow these waves are most easily and strongly excited by varying winds as near-inertial oscillations (NIOs). These motions have been overlooked in the previous studies since they are absent under the traditional approximation. The observations which employed buoys with thermistors, ADCPs and two 16.3 MHz WERA HF radars were carried out in the Gulf of Lyons in April-June 2006. The observations support the theoretical picture: a pronounced inertial band response occurs only in the presence of shallow stratification and is confined to the mixed layer; the NIO penetration below the stratified layer is weak. NIO surface magnitude and vertical localization are strongly affected by the presence of even weak density stratification in the upper ten meters. The NIO surface signatures are easily captured by HF radars. Continuous 1.8 year HF observations near the Porquerolles Island confirm that shallow stratification is indeed the precondition for a strong NIO response. The response sensitivity to stratification provides a foundation for developing HF radar probing of stratification and, indirectly, vertical mixing, including spotting dramatic mixing events and spikes of vertical heat, mass and momentum exchange.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><i>The corresponding author address</i><p>: Prof. Victor Shrira, </p><i>Department of Mathematics,</i><p> Keele University, Newcastle under Lyme ST5 5BG, United Kingdom; email: </p><a class="email" href="mailto:v.i.shrira@keele.ac.uk">v.i.shrira@keele.ac.uk</a></div></div><p class="articleDivider"/></div>
