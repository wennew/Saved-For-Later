		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The volume transport of nutrient-rich continental shelf water into a cyclonic frontal eddy (entrainment) was examined from satellite observations, a slocum glider and numerical simulation outputs. Within the frontal eddy, parcels of water with temperature/salinity signatures of the continental shelf (18-19C and >35.5 respectively) were recorded. The distribution of patches of shelf water observed within the eddy were consistent with the spiral pattern shown within the numerical simulations. A numerical dye-tracer experiment showed that the surface waters ( 50m depth) of the frontal eddy are almost entirely ( 95%) shelf waters. Particle tracking experiments showed that water was drawn into the eddy from over 4 degrees of latitude (30-34.5S). Consistent with the glider observations, the modeled particles entrained into the eddy sunk relative to their initial position. Particles released south of 33S, where the waters are cooler and denser, sunk 30-50m deeper than their release position. Distance to the shelf was a critical factor in determining the volume of shelf water entrained into the eddy. Entrainment reduced to 0.23 Sv when the eddy was furthest from the shelf, compared to 0.61 Sv when the eddy was within 10km of the shelf. From a biological perspective, quantifying the entrainment of shelf water into frontal eddies is important, as it is thought to play a significant role in providing an offshore nursery habitat for coastally-spawned larval fish.
