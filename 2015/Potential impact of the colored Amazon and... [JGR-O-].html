		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The Amazon and the Orinoco river plumes modulate ocean stratification and color in the tropical North Atlantic. This changes air-sea interactions and may thus be important for tropical cyclones (TCs). Using a regional ocean model, we try to separate the potential impact of river freshwater and light absorption on ocean temperatures, stability, and TC intensity. While the freshwater plume stabilizes the water column, there is no significant change in sea surface temperatures. However, increased stability and temperature inversions may reduce surface cooling feedbacks. The cooling inhibition index (CI) is <img alt="image" src="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2014JC010533/asset/image_n/jgrc21088-gra-0001.png?v=1&amp;s=99da6309cb6777c256e6bf1e96c21c51fa9d422d"> larger when the river freshwater plume is present.
