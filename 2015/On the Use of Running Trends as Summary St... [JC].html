This produces a new series called <i>running trends series</i> which is used as summary statistics of the original series for further analysis. In recent years, RTA has been widely used in climate applied research as summary statistics for time series and time series association. There is no doubt that RTA might be a useful descriptive tool, but, despite its general use in applied research, precisely what it reveals about the underlying time series is unclear and, as a result, its interpretation is unclear too. In this paper we contribute to such interpretation in two ways: 1) we obtain an explicit formula for the set of time series with a given series of running trends, which allow us to show that running trends, alone, perform very poorly as summary statistics for univariate time series and time series association; and 2) we establish an equivalence between RTA and trend estimation of a (possibly non-linear) trend component of the underlying time series using a weighted moving average filter. Such equivalence provides a solid ground for RTA implementation and interpretation/validation. In this respect, we propose as diagnostic tools for RTA: (i) the plot of the original series, with RTA trend estimation superposed; (ii) the average R-square and the percentage of statistically significant running trends across windows; and (iii) the plot of the running trends series with the corresponding confidence intervals.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><p>* </p><i>Corresponding author address:</i><p> Statistics and Operational Research Department, University of Alicante, Apartado de Correos 99, Alicante, Spain.
