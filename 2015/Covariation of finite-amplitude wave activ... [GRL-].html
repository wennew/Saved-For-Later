		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Tropospheric eddy-mean flow interaction is formulated in terms of the vertically integrated budget of finite-amplitude wave activity (FAWA). At each latitude the dynamics is governed by three coupled equations for the interior- and surface FAWA and barotropic zonal-mean zonal flow. In midlatitude austral summer, the budget reveals a largely adiabatic, antiphase covariation of FAWA and the mean flow. A marked periodicity is found for FAWA around 20-30 days, consistent with the recently discovered <em>Baroclinic Annular Mode</em>. The difference in the spectra of FAWA and the mean flow arises from (i) distinct spectra of low-level meridional eddy heat flux and the barotropic eddy momentum flux convergence, and (ii) strong thermal damping of surface wave activity: the latter makes the FAWA respond largely to the low-level meridional eddy heat flux at low frequencies, whereas the zonal-mean flow responds to the momentum flux convergence whose spectrum is broader and occupies higher frequencies.</p></div>
