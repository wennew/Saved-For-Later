		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Satellite altimetry is regularly used to map the global distribution of mode-1 internal tides. Validating altimeter measurements of internal tides with in situ data is difficult as the mooring observations typically are too short compared with the altimetry. Here taking advantage of the long-term (since 1999) Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean/Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TAO/TRITON) buoy observations at 2°S–156°E located at a TOPEX/Poseidon crossover in a region of strong internal tides, direct comparisons are made between altimeter and in situ measurements over a common 15 year period. The hourly buoy data are decimated every 9.9 day to emulate altimeter measurements. The altimeter and decimated buoy data are highly coherent at the aliased semidiurnal period (~60 day), and they agree well for the stationary semidiurnal internal tide. For the nonstationary internal tide, which consists of a significant annual cycle, the demodulated amplitude from the altimeter appears to be contaminated by nontidal signals. The demodulated amplitude from the decimated buoy data, on the other hand, is capable of resolving the temporal variability. This suggests the potential of mapping nonstationary internal tides from satellites.</p></div>
