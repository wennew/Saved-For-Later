		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Seasonal variations of the upper ocean, such as mixed layer depth (MLD) and sea surface temperature (SST), responding to the atmospheric forcing in the North Pacific (10<sup>o</sup>N – 50<sup>o</sup>N), are investigated by analyzing the Argo and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 1 data. The OAFlux data are also used for comparison. During the early heating period in the high-latitude ocean north of 30<sup>o</sup>N, where a seasonal thermocline is formed above the deep mixed layer under strong surface heating, the MLD <em>h</em> is found to be scaled as <em>h</em>∝(<em>Lλ</em>)<sup>1/2</sup>, where <em>L</em> is the Monin-Obukhov length scale and <em>λ</em> is the Ekman length scale. On the other hand, in the low latitude ocean south of 30<sup>o</sup>N, where the preexisting MLD is shallow and surface heating is weak, <em>h</em> is found to be scaled by <em>λ</em>. It is found that a large amount of heat flux across the MLD occurs, especially in the high-latitude ocean during the late heating period, in which <em>h</em> is small. It suggests the contribution by turbulent mixing across the MLD in addition to radiation penetration, and the eddy diffusivity in the high-latitude ocean is estimated as K<em><sub>v</sub></em> ∼ 10<sup>−4</sup> - 10<sup>−3</sup> m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. The heat budget of the mixed layer reveals that the contribution from the ocean heat transport is much smaller than the surface heat flux in the high-latitude ocean except in the Kuroshio region, but it is sometimes comparable in the low-latitude ocean.
