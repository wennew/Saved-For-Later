		<h3>Abstract</h3><div><p>The impact on the upper ocean of the passage of a short, intense storm over a Southern Ocean site, in proximity to an Antarctic Circumpolar Current front, is characterized.

Subsequent measurements show the upper ocean to have restratified, injecting near-inertial shear in stratified waters within 1 day of the storm's passage.
