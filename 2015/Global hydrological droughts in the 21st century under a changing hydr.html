		<b>Global hydrological droughts in the 21st century under a changing hydrological regime</b><br><br>Earth System Dynamics, 6, 1-15, 2015<br><br>Author(s): N. Wanders, Y. Wada, and H. A. J. Van Lanen<br><br>Climate change very likely impacts future hydrological drought
characteristics across the world. Here, we quantify the impact of
climate change on future low flows and associated hydrological
drought characteristics on a global scale using an alternative
drought identification approach that considers adaptation to future
changes in hydrological regime. The global hydrological model
PCR-GLOBWB was used to simulate daily discharge at 0.5°
globally for 1971–2099. The model was forced with CMIP5 climate
projections taken from five global circulation models (GCMs) and four emission scenarios (representative concentration pathways, RCPs),
from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project.
<br><br>
Drought events occur when discharge is below a threshold. The
conventional variable threshold (VTM) was calculated by deriving the
threshold from the period 1971–2000. The transient variable
threshold (VTM<sub>t</sub>) is a non-stationary approach,
where the threshold is based on the discharge values of the previous
30 years implying the threshold to vary every year during the 21st
century. The VTM<sub>t</sub> adjusts to gradual changes in
the hydrological regime as response to climate change.
<br><br>
Results show a significant negative trend in the low flow regime
over the 21st century for large parts of South America, southern
Africa, Australia and the Mediterranean. In 40–52% of the
world reduced low flows are projected, while increased low flows are
found in the snow-dominated climates.
<br><br>
In 27% of the global area both the drought duration and the
deficit volume are expected to increase when applying the
VTM<sub>t</sub>. However, this area will significantly
increase to 62% when the VTM is applied. The mean global area
in drought, with the VTM<sub>t</sub>, remains rather
constant (11.7 to 13.4%), compared to the substantial
increase when the VTM is applied (11.7 to 20%).
<br><br>
The study illustrates that an alternative drought identification
that considers adaptation to an altered hydrological regime has
a substantial influence on future hydrological drought characteristics.
