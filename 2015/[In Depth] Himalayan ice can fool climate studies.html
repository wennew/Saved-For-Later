                     <p id="p-3">Many glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating, but some glaciers in the Karakoram Range, at the geographic intersection of
                        India, Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan, appear to be on the march. Climate-change skeptics sometimes use these advancing
                        glaciers to argue that Himalayan glaciers are healthy. But new research based on satellite images and on-the-ground records
                        shows that what looks like a steady advance is in many cases just a temporary surge. And even though a surging glacier appears
                        to be expanding, it may be losing mass, its upper reaches collapsing even as its snout thickens temporarily. Such surging
                        glaciers may say little about climate change.
