		<b>Technical Note: Watershed strategy for oceanic mesoscale eddy splitting</b><br><br>Ocean Science, 11, 269-273, 2015<br><br>Author(s): Q. Y. Li and L. Sun<br><br>To identify oceanic mononuclear mesoscale eddies, a threshold-free splitting
method was developed based on the watershed. Because oceanic eddies are
similar to plateaus and basins in the map of the sea level anomaly (SLA)
data, the natural divisions of the basins are the watersheds between them.
The splitting algorithm is based on identifying these watersheds by finding
the path of steepest descent. Compared to previous splitting methods, the
proposed splitting algorithm has some advantages. First, there are no
artificial parameters. Second, the algorithm is robust; the splitting
strategy is independent of the algorithm and procedure and automatically
guarantees that the split mononuclear eddies are simply connected pixel
sets. Third, the new method is very fast, and the time complexity is
<i>O(N)</i>, where <i>N</i> is the number of multinuclear eddy pixels; each pixel is scanned
only once for splitting, regardless of how many extremes there are. Fourth,
the algorithm is independent of parameters; the strategy can potentially be
applied to any possible physical parameters (e.g. SLA, geostrophic
potential vorticity, Okubo–Weiss parameter). Besides, the present
strategy can also be applied to automatic identification of troughs and
ridges from weather charts. Because this general method can be applied to a
variety of eddy parameter fields, we denoted it the Universal Splitting
Technology for Circulations (USTC) method.
