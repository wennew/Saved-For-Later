					<p>The 7H δ<sup>18</sup>O record shows remarkable similarities to Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate records, both at orbital and millennial timescales. Positive δ<sup>18</sup>O excursions of 7H (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#f2">Fig. 2b</a>) match the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) δ<sup>18</sup>O record (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#f2">Fig. 2f</a>) for Interstadials (I) 3 and 4 within dating uncertainties<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Svensson, A. et al.

The timing of the rapid δ<sup>18</sup>O increase at the onset of the Bølling (that is, I-1e at 14.70 ka) is identical with the timing in NGRIP and led to a stalagmite growth stop due to the waning of the glacier cover in the hydrological catchment of the cave system.

		<p>In contrast to the NGRIP record, the 7H δ<sup>18</sup>O record is characterized by an absolute minimum centred at ca 25.3 ka, consistent with the maximum Alpine glacier advance inferred from independently dated geomorphological field evidence<sup><a href="#ref17" title="Monegato, G. et al.

Rapid ecosystem response to abrupt climate changes during the last glacial period in western Europe, 40–16 ka. Geology 36, 407–410 (2008)." id="ref-link-33">19</a></sup>, which has been interpreted to reflect primary changes in soil moisture availability. Based on these evidences, we surmise that the 7H δ<sup>18</sup>O record mirrors changes in the mass balance of LGM glaciers in the Alps and thus predominantly reflects changes in the Alpine precipitation pattern<sup><a href="#ref8" title="Florineth, D. &amp; Schlüchter, C.

Intense southerly moisture advection is known to be related to pronounced Rossby-wave breaking west of the Alps, which induces enhanced meridional flow of moist and warm subtropical air towards the mountain range<sup><a href="#ref20" title="Martius, O., Zenklusen, E., Schwierz, C. &amp; Davies, HC. Episodes of Alpine heavy precipitation with an overlying elongated stratospheric intrusion: a climatology. Int. J. Climatol. 26, 149–1164 (2006)." id="ref-link-35">20</a></sup>. Such transport patterns may have been dominant during the LGM when both a larger (winter) sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic<sup><a href="#ref21" title="Strandberg, G., Brendefelt, J., Kjellström, E. &amp; Smith, B.

Since the tropics and subtropics experienced comparatively less temperature changes during glacial-interglacial cycles, the subtropical moisture reservoir could have provided sufficient moisture for precipitation to build up and maintain ice domes in the Alps with meridional moisture transport events. The strong correlation between the 7H-record and the Alpine ice mass balance (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#f2">Fig. 2c</a>) suggests that this atmospheric circulation pattern may have been a characteristic mechanism of moisture delivery to the Alps during the LGM.</p><p>Accordingly, we propose that, during the LGM, the isotopic composition of 7H primarily recorded changes in the position of the North Atlantic storm track and associated changes of moisture advection to the Alps. This hypothesis is generally consistent with global climate simulations suggesting an overall southward displacement of the storm track during the LGM<sup><a href="#ref3" title="Laîné, A. et al.

High-resolution regional simulation of the last glacial maximum climate in Europe. Tellus 63A, 107–125 (2011)." id="ref-link-39">21</a></sup>.

The presence of liquid water in the 7H karst system at 1,750 m a.s.l., however, challenges an estimated mean annual air temperature of −10 to −15 °C at the ELA of glaciers<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Haeberli, W. &amp; Penz, U.

Owing to their transient nature, such events are hardly reflected in the mean annual air temperature record<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Sodemann, H., Schwierz, C. &amp; Wernli, H. Interannual variability of Greenland winter precipitation sources: Lagrangian moisture diagnostic and North Atlantic Oscillation influence. J. Geophys. Res. Atm 113, D3 (2008)." id="ref-link-42">23</a></sup> and the relatively small changes in the temperature of condensation only had a minor influence on the isotopic composition. Similarly, the extraordinarily cold and dry climate during the LGM makes it unlikely to explain the depletion in δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>cc</sub> by a seasonal shift towards more winter precipitation. Instead, we propose that a higher fraction of precipitation was transported across the Alpine mountain range from the South because of a change in the predominant synoptic circulation pattern. The higher orographic barrier along the southerly transport path cause more moisture to condensate resulting in an orographically induced Rayleigh fractionation process (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 7</a>). Accordingly, phases of more depleted δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>cc</sub> are associated with the preferential advection of moisture from the South (see <a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Discussion</a>), whereas less depleted δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>cc</sub> values primarily reflect air masses reaching the northern Alps directly from the Northwest (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>). Based on the apparent correlation between the Remanzacco oscillations of the LGM South Alpine Tagliamento paleoglacier<sup><a href="#ref17" title="Monegato, G. et al. Evidence of a two-fold glacial advance during the last glacial maximum in the Tagliamento end moraine system (eastern Alps). Quat. Res. 68, 284–302 (2007)." id="ref-link-43">17</a></sup> and the 7H-record, the 50% threshold is assessed at δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>cc</sub> −12.4±0.1‰, which corresponds to ca −16.3‰ on the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) scale (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#f4">Fig. 4</a>). Because δ<sup>18</sup>O at the oceanic moisture source has not changed substantially during the LGM, a two end-member mixing model allows to derive that the contribution of moisture crossing the Alps may have varied between 25 and 65% during the LGM.</p>

	<p>Associating the (Alpine) LGM with a change in the synoptic circulation pattern rather than an insolation minimum enables alternative interpretations for the causes of major glacier advances in the Alps. We note that the 7H δ<sup>18</sup>O minimum predated the precession maximum at 22 ka (ref. <a href="#ref24" title="Berger, A. &amp; Loutre, M. F. Insolation values for the climate of the last 10 million years. Quat. Sci. Rev. 10, 297–317 (1991)." id="ref-link-44">24</a>) by ca 3 ka, suggesting a combined effect of precession and obliquity on the timing of the last Alpine glaciation, and thus possibly also on its global counterpart<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Huybers, P. Combined obliquity and precession pacing of the late Pleistocene deglaciation. Nature 480, 229–232 (2011)." id="ref-link-45">25</a></sup>. Evidence of de-phasing with respect to the precessional band has been reported from marine and terrestrial records<sup><a href="#ref26" title="Drysdale, R. N. et al. Evidence for obliquity forcing of glacial Termination II. Science 325, 1527–1531 (2009)." id="ref-link-46">26</a></sup>, but interpretations were mainly focused on the timing of deglaciation. Although changes in obliquity influence the latitudinal distribution of solar radiation and thus control glacier ablation<sup><a href="#ref27" title="Huybers, P. Early Pleistocene glacial cycles and the integrated summer insolation forcing. Science 313, 508–511 (2006)." id="ref-link-47">27</a></sup>, its effect on ice accumulation is less obvious. Yet, the obliquity minimum at 29 ka (ref. <a href="#ref24" title="Berger, A. &amp; Loutre, M. F. Insolation values for the climate of the last 10 million years. Quat. Sci. Rev. 10, 297–317 (1991)." id="ref-link-48">24</a>) implies reduced energy input at high latitudes. The associated cooling of the Northern Hemisphere likely favoured a drop in the ELA, as exemplified by the start of speleothem growth at 7H at 30 ka. With tropical and subtropical areas being less affected by changes in obliquity, meridional temperature gradients and therefore also pressure gradients became steeper, strengthening the jet stream, which, together with an expansion of the Fennoscandian ice sheet, progressively migrated southwards<sup><a href="#ref3" title="Laîné, A. et al. Northern hemisphere storm tracks during the last glacial maximum in the PMIP2 ocean-atmosphere coupled models: energetic study, seasonal cycle, precipitation. Clim. Dynam. 32, 593–614 (2009)." id="ref-link-49">3</a></sup>. This may have led to enhanced synoptic storm activity in North-Atlantic mid-latitudes, and possibly also in areas further downstream, because of jet stream excursions induced by the interaction between the jet and a quasi-stationary blocking over the Fennoscandian ice sheet (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). The concomitant decline of the mid-latitude vegetation cover increased the potential global dust emissions by nearly 38% (ref. <a href="#ref28" title="Lunt, D. J. &amp; Valdes, P. J. Dust deposition and provenance at the Last Glacial Maximum and present day. Geophys. Res. Lett. 29, 2085 (2002)." id="ref-link-50">28</a>). An intriguing similarity is noted between the Ca record of NGRIP and the 7H δ<sup>18</sup>O record (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#f2">Fig. 2e</a>), which is particularly pronounced between 28 and 23 ka (that is, <i>r</i>≥0.60 between 25.5 and 23.0 ka; <a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 8</a>). Elevated dust concentrations in Greenland ice cores correlate with depleted δ<sup>18</sup>O values in 7H. This increased dust mobilization during periods when the storm track was dominantly south of the Alps supports a potential teleconnection between North Atlantic moisture transport and storminess in East Asian regions (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150227/ncomms7344/full/ncomms7344.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Discussion</a>). Concurrently, the preferential transport of moisture towards the southern flank of the Alps favoured snow accumulation in the glaciological catchment of the large piedmont glaciers. These results are not only consistent with independent geomorphological evidence<sup><a href="#ref7" title="Bini, A. et al. Switzerland during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 1:500000 Federal Office of Topography Swisstopo (2009)." id="ref-link-51">7</a>, <a href="#ref8" title="Florineth, D. &amp; Schlüchter, C. Alpine evidence for atmospheric circulation patterns in Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum. Quat. Res. 54, 295–308 (2000)." id="ref-link-52">8</a></sup> but also argue for a non-uniform ice build-up in the Alps during the LGM. Accordingly, we expect regional differences in the timing of valley glacier advances depending on the location of the glaciers’ accumulation areas.</p><p>We conclude that the Alpine glaciers responded in a sensitive way to Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation patterns during the LGM. Therefore, this mountain range represents a key location for identifying large-scale atmospheric reorganizations in the North Atlantic climate systems. The importance of moisture advection towards the Alps for glacier advances calls for high-resolution GCM simulations of the LGM climate, which could be tested extensively using 7H as a benchmark.</p>
