					<p>A Picarro L2130-<i>i</i> analyzer (hereafter Picarro water vapor analyzer) measured δ<sup>18</sup>O, δ<sup>2</sup>H, and water concentration (g/kg) of vapor. The L2130-<i>i</i> is a cavity ring down-spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer, which is based on cavity-enhanced, near-infrared laser absorption spectroscopy procedures, tuned on a narrow spectral region<sup><a href="#ref41" title="Brand, W.

Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry 23, 2534–2542, doi:10.1002/rcm.4100 (2009)." id="ref-link-71">43</a></sup>. The Picarro water vapor analyzer, powered by a nearby solar array, was deployed in undisturbed moist acidic tundra on a small knoll about 1 km from the Toolik camp (Fig. S3). Annually, Toolik receives ~32 cm of precipitation and the average annual temperature is -7 °C<sup>19</sup>. A tower was set up adjacent to the Picarro analyzer to collect air samples and meteorological data. A tube was placed at the top of the tower (3.2 m) and connected to the analyzer and samples were collected from May 11, 2013 to August 20, 2013. Samples were collected through the tube with a pump, which ran continuously at a rate of 5 liters/second. The ratios of water vapor isotopes were measured approximately every second by the Picarro water vapor analyzer and five-minute average values were evaluated in this study (except <a href="/srep/2015/150527/srep10295/full/srep10295.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>, which utilizes higher temporal resolution data for presentation purposes). Twice a day (approximately every 12 hours), standard waters were injected and analyzed to correct for potential drift of the instrument. Low absolute humidity values (e.g., &lt;5 g/kg) can lead to isotopic biases of at least 5.0 and 50.0 per mil for δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H, respectively<sup><a href="#ref44" title="Bailey, A., Toohey, D. &amp; Noone, D. Characterizing moisture exchange between the Hawaiian convective boundary layer and free troposphere using stable isotopes in water.

As absolute humidity during the cyclone event was &gt;10 g/kg and within previously observed ranges (Fig. S2), the cyclone-related <i>d-excess</i> values were not likely influenced by humidity related isotopic biases. The results of stable isotope analyses are presented using the δ-notation reported relative to the Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) standard, with an accuracy of ±0.2‰ for δ<sup>18</sup>O and ±2‰ for δ<sup>2</sup>H. Additionally, a remote, automated weather station (Campbell Scientific Custom with CR1000 Datalogger and various sensors) was established to collect meteorological data: temperature (thermistor) and relative humidity (capacitive sensors) at 1.7 m and wind speed and direction (Young Windbird) at a 3.2 m height. Sensors were scanned at 30 second intervals and average readings were logged every five and 30 minutes from May 11, 2013 to August 20, 2013, same as the collection time period of isotope data. The day of year (DOY) is presented in Julian form and commences at midnight in the Alaska Standard Time zone.</p><p>Deuterium excess (δD – 8*δ<sup>18</sup>O), or <i>d-excess</i>, values were calculated from the isotopic data as they can be indicative of differing storm tracks<sup><a href="#ref45" title="Sjostrom, D.

The <i>d-excess</i> of water vapor above the ocean is largely influenced by the following at the moisture source: composition of sea surface isotopes; sea surface temperatures; air temperature; and relative humidity<sup><a href="#ref46" title="Masson-Delmotte, V. et al. GRIP deuterium excess reveals rapid and orbital-scale changes in Greenland moisture origin. Science 309, 118–121 (2005)." id="ref-link-80">46</a></sup>. As these source oceanic isotopic conditions are mostly preserved in the <i>d-excess</i> values as an air parcel moves from its source to a collection site, <i>d-excess</i> can help understand the environmental and isotopic conditions of a moisture source. Comparatively, the separate δ<sup>2</sup>H and δ<sup>18</sup>O isotopes are more influenced by local environmental conditions (e.g., temperature) at the sample collection site<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Jouzel, J. et al. Rapid deuterium-excess changes in Greenland ice cores: a link between the ocean and the atmosphere. Comptes Rendus Geoscience 337, 957–969, doi:10.1016/j.crte.2005.05.011 (2005)." id="ref-link-81">23</a>, <a href="#ref46" title="Masson-Delmotte, V. et al. GRIP deuterium excess reveals rapid and orbital-scale changes in Greenland moisture origin. Science 309, 118–121 (2005)." id="ref-link-82">46</a></sup>. Therefore, <i>d-excess</i> is particularly useful for the study goal of understanding and interpreting the isotopic conditions of an Arctic Ocean cyclone. These <i>d-excess</i> values were stratified into two groups: high (&gt;16.9‰) and low (&lt;−9.8‰). High values were greater than two standard deviations above the mean <i>d-excess</i> value, while low values were lower than two standard deviations below the mean <i>d-excess</i> value. The <i>d-excess</i>, and correspon<i>d</i>ing δ<sup>18</sup>O, values in the Fig. 3b and 3c schematics for vapor from open or frozen ocean water and terrestrial water moisture sources are estimated<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Clark, I.

Fractionnement en oxygene-18 et en deuterium entre l’eau et sa vapeur. Journal of Chemical Physics 197, 1423–1436 (1971)." id="ref-link-84">36</a></sup>, while all other isotope values are known (including the northern and southern Alaska open terrestrial waters)<sup><a href="#ref35" title="Welker, J. M. Alaska Water Isotope Network (University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, 2014)." id="ref-link-85">35</a></sup>.</p><p>Air parcel back-trajectory analyses, of the <i>d-excess</i> values prior, during, and after the cyclone event, were calculated using the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s Air Resource Laboratory HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model<sup><a href="#ref47" title="Draxler, R. &amp; Rolph, G. HYSPLIT (HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model &lt;http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready/hysplit4.htm&gt; (2003, Date of access: 20/11/2013)." id="ref-link-86">47</a></sup>. The HYSPLIT model calculates the position of an air parcel using variables such as temperature, wind speed, pressure, and solar radiation. While models in previous studies primarily used wind data for back trajectory calculation<sup><a href="#ref48" title="Barras, V. &amp; Simmonds, I. Observation and modeling of stable water isotopes as diagnostics of rainfall dynamics over southeastern Australia. Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres (1984–2012) 114, doi:10.1029/2009JD012132 (2009)." id="ref-link-87">48</a></sup>, meteorological variables like temperature are incorporated into HYSPLIT as they also influence air parcel movements, which were calculated within HYSPLIT by a Lagrangian three dimensional air parcel velocity algorithm<sup><a href="#ref49" title="Draxler, R. &amp; Hess, G. Description of the HYSPLIT4 modeling system. (1997)." id="ref-link-88">49</a></sup>. The back trajectories were calculated for a 72-hr period before the time of the sample measurement at an altitude of 500 m above base-level. It is possible that evaporative processes beyond this 72-hr period influenced water vapor isotope ratios, but this impact is likely to be minimal as three days is generally long enough to identify moisture source characteristics<sup><a href="#ref50" title="Trenberth, K. E. Atmospheric moisture residence times and cycling: Implications for rainfall rates and climate change. Climatic Change 39, 667–694, doi:10.1023/A:1005319109110 (1998)." id="ref-link-89">50</a></sup>. An altitude of 500 m was selected to allow for air movement below the tropopause (usually above 10,000 m), but above the altitude where ground features generally could influence wind direction<sup><a href="#ref51" title="Sumner, G. Precipitation: process and analysis. (Wiley 1988)." id="ref-link-90">51</a></sup>. Back trajectory calculations were used to help associate particular isotopic values (e.g., <i>d-excess</i>) from vapor samples with air parcel movements that are indicative of Arctic cyclonic activity.</p>
