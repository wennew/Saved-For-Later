<p dir="ltr"><span>It is a truth almost universally acknowledged&#13;
that the shale gas revolution has led to a fall in US emissions.&#13;
But what if that wasn't true?</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>New</span> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8714"><span>research</span></a>&#13;
<span>published in Nature Communications suggests it was the global&#13;
financial crisis, not fracking, that has done most to reduce carbon&#13;
dioxide (CO2) emissions from the US.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The paper concludes:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"After 2007, decreasing&#13;
emissions were largely a result of economic&#13;
recession...substitution of gas for coal has had a relatively minor&#13;
role."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Carbon Brief looks at the findings, and why they&#13;
could be politically significant.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Conventional wisdom</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The idea that shale gas has been behind US&#13;
emissions reductions is repeated in</span> <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324763404578430751849503848">&#13;
<span>news coverage</span></a><span>, speeches and</span> <a href="http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/energy-and-climate/coal-killer">&#13;
<span>reports</span></a><span>. It is used by gas</span> <a href="http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/britain-still-needs-shale-gas.aspx">&#13;
<span>advocates</span></a> <span>making the case for fracking in&#13;
the UK. It has entered the political consciousness and is widely&#13;
accepted as fact.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>This conventional wisdom runs to the highest&#13;
levels of scientific analysis. In its latest assessment report the&#13;
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span> <a href="http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf">&#13;
<span>says</span></a> <span>fracking is "an important reason for a&#13;
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United&#13;
States".</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the US context, shale gas is seen as a key&#13;
reason both for emissions reductions and in creating the political&#13;
space necessary to take action on climate change.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>One veteran of the Congressional climate and&#13;
energy debate has told Carbon Brief that shale gas had changed the&#13;
political conversation. During</span> <a href="/blog/2014/06/supreme-court-backs-obama%E2%80%99s-plan-to-sidestep-congress-and-regulate-carbon-emissions/">&#13;
<span>failed attempts</span></a> <span>to impose a national&#13;
cap-and-trade scheme, the talk was of expensive overseas gas being&#13;
imported to help limit emissions.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Now, the source said, almost all of the&#13;
emissions reductions required to meet President Obama's</span> <a href="/blog/2014/06/three-key-components-of-obama%E2%80%99s-carbon-pollution-plan/">&#13;
<span>Clean Power Plan</span></a> <span>are expected to come from&#13;
coal-to-gas switching, using cheap US shale gas.</span></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sizing shale's influence</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Given this expectation, a lot is riding on&#13;
whether or not shale gas really has reduced emissions. The&#13;
relevance of fracking for emissions reductions has been challenged&#13;
before. Yet while previous</span> <a href="/blog/2014/10/what-is-the-impact-on-the-us-emissions-of-switching-from-coal-to-gas/">&#13;
<span>efforts</span></a> <span>have disagreed on the details, they&#13;
have tended to assume a major role for shale.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The new research challenges this thinking head&#13;
on. The authors say:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"Despite potentially&#13;
significant implications for US climate and energy policy, there&#13;
has been no quantitative analysis of whether the gas boom and&#13;
changes in the fuel mix of the power sector are indeed driving the&#13;
decrease in US CO2 emissions."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Using an approach called structural&#13;
decomposition analysis, the researchers attempt to break apart the&#13;
factors behind changes in US emissions. The method is frequently&#13;
applied at regional or national level to understand emissions&#13;
trends.  They use detailed sectoral data on energy use,&#13;
intensity and economic activity to identify the most important&#13;
reasons for shifts in CO2 emissions.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>They consider: population growth; per-capita&#13;
consumption; shifts in the types of goods and services people buy;&#13;
structural shifts between services and manufacturing, as well as&#13;
the quantity and type of goods used by industry; the amount of&#13;
energy used per unit of wealth; and changes in the fuel&#13;
mix.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The 10% cut in CO2 between 2007 and 2009 was&#13;
"primarily the result of the economic recession", the paper says.&#13;
Falls in per capita consumption and changes in the structure of&#13;
industry account for 83% of this (red and blue bars, below left),&#13;
and fuel mix changes just 17% (orange).</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><span><img src="/media/425168/shale-annual-emissions_600x288.jpg" alt="Shale -annual -emissions"/></span></p>&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><em>Contributors to changing US CO2 emissions in three&#13;
two-year periods covering 2007 to 2013. Source: Feng et&#13;
al.</em></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>During the economic recovery, increases in&#13;
population and rebounding consumption pushed emissions upwards.&#13;
These were slightly outweighed by reductions due to fuel mix,&#13;
production structure, consumption patterns and energy intensity&#13;
(centre and right-hand areas, above).</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Shale's small impact</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Significantly, in terms of which of these&#13;
factors were most important, the paper says:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"Contrary to&#13;
conventional wisdom, our decomposition analysis shows that changes&#13;
in the fuel mix of the energy sector (including those related to&#13;
the shale gas boom) account for a relatively small portion of this&#13;
decrease."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The rise of renewables, tightening air pollution&#13;
standards and shale-driven reductions in gas prices saw coal's&#13;
share of the US power mix fall from 46% in 2009 to 39% in&#13;
2014</span><span>. Gas recently topped coal as the top source of&#13;
electricity for the</span> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/14/gas-surges-ahead-of-coal-in-us-power-generation">&#13;
<span>first time</span></a><span>.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Despite these profound shifts in the US power&#13;
sector, today's new research suggests other factors have been&#13;
equally or more important in reducing emissions. It points, among&#13;
other reasons, to falling oil use as cars became more efficient and&#13;
the offshoring of emissions-intensive industries.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>However,</span> <a href="http://www.edf.org/people/mark-brownstein"><span>Mark S&#13;
Brownstein</span></a><span>, vice president at the Environmental&#13;
Defense Fund's climate &amp; energy program, tells Carbon Brief&#13;
that further study is required to better understand the specific&#13;
impacts of the various factors at play:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"The methodology cannot&#13;
be used to infer anything about the direct impacts of specific&#13;
policies, such as power plant emissions limits or renewable&#13;
portfolio standards, or the effect that changes in relative prices&#13;
may have on fuel choice, such as the impact of the change in supply&#13;
or price of natural gas or renewables may have had on the&#13;
competitiveness of coal. Economic modeling would be required to&#13;
discern these impacts."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>End of the gas bridge?</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The study seems to undermine those that say&#13;
shale gas has been good for the climate. Given the strength&#13;
of</span> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/16/natural-gas-renewable-fuels-fracking-column/27089397/">&#13;
<span>support</span></a> <span>for shale gas in some quarters,&#13;
however, it's unlikely to pass unchallenged.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>It's also not the first time the</span> <a href="/blog/2015/05/climate-benefits-of-a-natural-gas-bridge/"><span>&#13;
natural gas bridge</span></a> <span>has been questioned.&#13;

<span>renewables and nuclear</span></a><span>, as well as&#13;

&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>On the other hand, US emissions might have&#13;
increased without shale gas's contribution to displacing coal, even&#13;
if it hasn't had as much to do with falling US emissions as&#13;
previously thought.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>So while today's research is a challenge to&#13;
conventional thinking on fracking's climate impact, it will not end&#13;
the argument for gas as a bridge from coal towards a lower-carbon&#13;
