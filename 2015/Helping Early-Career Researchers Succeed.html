Furthermore, those who typically organize a department's colloquia often fail to recognize ECIs as potential speakers because they lack name recognition. The lack of speaking opportunities not only hurts ECIs but also deprives departments of exposure to new blood and fresh ideas.</p><p>To address this challenge, the working group piloted two programs in 2014 to help ECIs develop new collaborations across the member institutions of the IRIS Consortium. In the inaugural year, five ECIs were awarded fund-matching lectureships to travel to another institution as a colloquium speaker, with extra time allotted (up to 1 week) to develop new collaborations. Under the second program, two ECIs were awarded extended stays of up to a month to collaborate with and learn from a senior scientist with complementary skills and give a colloquium talk.</p><p>The ECIs funded by the program reported new collaborations were indeed established, which resulted in meaningful science and proposal opportunities. Of the five ECI colloquium speakers, three submitted proposals to the NSF, and one presented preliminary results at the 2014 Seismological Society of America meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. Two additional proposals were submitted to NSF by ECIs who had extended junior-senior scientist visits.</p><strong>Moving Forward </strong><p>Today's ECI must understand the challenges that lie ahead, particularly given the weak domestic economic, government funding, and employment climate.Today's ECI must understand the challenges that lie ahead, particularly given the weak domestic economic, government funding, and employment climate. Feedback from ECIs to working group organizers indicates that ECIs know too little about employment opportunities outside of academia and the energy industry. Additionally, ECIs request guidance and resources on how the skills and expertise acquired in graduate school are applicable to the widest range of careers. The IRIS ECI working group continues to address these topics through workshops at annual meetings and webinars.</p><p>ECIs have requested that IRIS develop a formal mentoring program that pairs young geoscientists with mentors within their discipline. Ideally, the program would be a tiered-mentor network that consists of an undergraduate student, graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, pretenure faculty, and senior scientist. Such a program is also ideal for a mentor-training program, which could be done within, or across, several NSF-funded programs (e.g., EarthScope, GeoPRISMS, or IRIS).</p><strong>Expanding to Other Geoscience Disciplines</strong><p>Many of the concerns and potential resources described here are not specific to the solid Earth sciences, and the activities we have described are transferable to other disciplines. Other geoscience organizations and consortiums should consider a focused effort to develop resources for ECIs.</p><p>Furthermore, it would be beneficial to develop interdisciplinary resources that many different scientific communities and networks can share. This &quot;across the aisle&quot; collaboration is particularly important in today's increasingly limited funding environment, where collaborative research proposals that focus on interdisciplinary research are often more competitive.</p><p>The ECI working group is open to collaborations and partnerships with other consortiums, organizations, or groups to expand the reach of and increase the resources available to ECIs. We hope to work together to build a large-scale, geoscience-centric ECI organization to aid the success of ECIs, no matter what path they pursue.</p><strong>Author Information</strong><p>Harmony V.

Feedback from ECIs to working group organizers indicates that ECIs know too little about employment opportunities outside of academia and the energy industry. Additionally, ECIs request guidance and resources on how the skills and expertise acquired in graduate school are applicable to the widest range of careers. The IRIS ECI working group continues to address these topics through workshops at annual meetings and webinars.</p>
<p>ECIs have requested that IRIS develop a formal mentoring program that pairs young geoscientists with mentors within their discipline. Ideally, the program would be a tiered-mentor network that consists of an undergraduate student, graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, pretenure faculty, and senior scientist. Such a program is also ideal for a mentor-training program, which could be done within, or across, several NSF-funded programs (e.g., EarthScope, GeoPRISMS, or IRIS).</p>
<h3><strong>Expanding to Other Geoscience Disciplines</strong></h3>
<p>Many of the concerns and potential resources described here are not specific to the solid Earth sciences, and the activities we have described are transferable to other disciplines. Other geoscience organizations and consortiums should consider a focused effort to develop resources for ECIs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would be beneficial to develop interdisciplinary resources that many different scientific communities and networks can share. This “across the aisle” collaboration is particularly important in today’s increasingly limited funding environment, where collaborative research proposals that focus on interdisciplinary research are often more competitive.</p>
<p>The ECI working group is open to collaborations and partnerships with other consortiums, organizations, or groups to expand the reach of and increase the resources available to ECIs. We hope to work together to build a large-scale, geoscience-centric ECI organization to aid the success of ECIs, no matter what path they pursue.</p>
