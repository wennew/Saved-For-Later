L'Hégaret, R. Duarte, X. Carton, C. Vic, D. Ciani, R. Baraille, and S. Corréard<br><br>The Arabian Sea and Sea of Oman circulation and water masses, subject to
monsoon forcing, reveal a strong seasonal variability and intense mesoscale
features. We describe and analyze this variability and these features, using
both meteorological data (from ECMWF reanalyses), in situ observations (from
the ARGO float program and the GDEM – Generalized Digital Environmental mode
– climatology), satellite altimetry (from AVISO) and a regional simulation
with a primitive equation model (HYCOM – the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model).
The model and observations display comparable variability, and the model is
then used to analyze the three-dimensional structure of eddies and water
masses with higher temporal and spatial resolutions than the available
observations. The mesoscale features are highly seasonal, with the formation
of coastal currents, destabilizing into eddies, or the radiation of Rossby
waves from the Indian coast. The mesoscale eddies have a deep dynamical
influence and strongly drive the water masses at depth. In particular, in the
Sea of Oman, the Persian Gulf Water presents several offshore ejection sites
and a complex recirculation, depending on the mesoscale eddies. The
associated mechanisms range from coastal ejection via dipoles, alongshore
pulses due to a cyclonic eddy, to the formation of lee eddies downstream of
Ra's Al Hamra. This water mass is also captured inside the eddies via several
mechanisms, keeping high thermohaline characteristics in the Arabian Sea. The
variations of the outflow characteristics near the Strait of Hormuz are
