A relatively cold and cloudy start (not as cold and cloudy as the two previous rebound years) was compensated by a July that was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/jenga-july-2015.html\">ideal for melting</a>. A continuous bombardment of heat and sunshine for weeks on end has caused some late melting momentum which is now keeping sea ice extent and area numbers dropping relatively evenly, despite a switch in weather conditions since the beginning of the month (see <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/07/asi-2015-update-5-late-momentum.html\">ASI 2015 update 5: late momentum</a>).</p>\n<p>As expected, the 2015 trend line on most graphs is hovering between top 3 years 2012, 2007 and 2011, and rebound years 2013 and 2014. It's difficult to tell how low things will end up. Melting momentum is one thing, but at this stage of the melting season weather conditions have the last word. It's compaction rather than melting that determines the final shape of the ice pack, and compaction depends on which way the winds are blowing, which in turn depend on the constellation of cyclones and anti-cyclones, or high pressure areas. See this <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/end-zone-3-sea-level-pressure.html\">blog post</a> from an eternity ago, 2010, that explains how it works.</p>\n<p>And now for the details...</p>\n<p><span>Sea ice area (SIA)</span></p>\n<p>Here's the latest <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/\">Cryosphere Today</a> SIA chart, to which I've added <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,1112.msg61082.html#msg61082\">preliminary data</a> as calculated by Wipneus:</p> <a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c17f8c970b-pi\"><img title=\"CTSIA20150818\" alt=\"CTSIA20150818\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c17f8c970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a><br>In the past two days the 2015 trend line has dipped below the daily minimums of rebound years 2013 and 2014. With 3 weeks in the melting season left to go I think it's safe to say that the rebound in the CT SIA data set has essentially been eliminated. The only question now is whether 2015 can still end up 2nd or 3rd. It's almost impossible to predict, as all the minimums are huddled close together. It might just as well come in 4th or 5th. Bottom line is it'll be low yet again.\n<p><span>Sea ice extent (SIE)</span></p>\n<p>With sea ice extent it's a slightly different story, as can be seen on this graph based on data from the Japanese <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://ads.nipr.ac.jp/vishop/vishop-extent.html?N\">Arctic Data archive System</a> website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a5ee970d-pi\"><img title=\"IJISSIE20150818\" alt=\"IJISSIE20150818\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a5ee970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a>The trend lines are somewhat closer to each other, showing smaller fluctuations, and here the 2015 trend line will have to drop another 500K km2 to get below the 2013 and 2014 minimums. Some seriously favourable weather conditions will be needed for 2015 to make the top 3.</p>\n<p><span>Cryosphere Today area per IJIS extent (CAPIE)</span></p>\n<p>But the potential is there, if the CAPIE or compactness graph is to be believed:<a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865c5cf970d-pi\"><img title=\"CAPIE20150818\" alt=\"CAPIE20150818\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865c5cf970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>The CAPIE percentage is still among the lowest in the 2006-2015 period, lower than 2012 even, and this is in large part because of the heavy dispersal of the ice pack on the Pacific side of the Arctic, with a massive detachment of multi-year ice (I'll have more on that in a couple of days when all of the detached ice has melted out):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a662970d-pi\"><img title=\"Arctic_AMSR2_nic\" alt=\"Arctic_AMSR2_nic\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a662970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>If winds turn and push all that dispersed ice together towards the Canadian Archipelago, area and especially extent may go quite a bit lower. This is what made 2007 the record year it was, as winds blowing in the right direction caused heavy compaction in the final weeks of the melting season. Years like 2010 and 2013 didn't fulfil their potential because cyclones kept the ice pack dispersed until freezing temperatures started the process of ice re-growth and all the open water between floes iced over.</p>\n<p><span>Regional SIE and SIA</span></p>\n<p>In anticipation of that upcoming blog post on the detachment of an 'arm' of ice in the Beaufort Sea, its disappearance and the consequences for multi-year ratios, I can already show you the difference compared to two weeks ago, thanks to this fantastic map produced by commenter Wipneus who <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,382.msg60601.html#msg60601\">makes</a> his own sea ice concentration maps using the highest resolution AMSR-2 data (3.125 km grid) provided by the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/new-map-on-the-block.html\">University of Hamburg</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16048970b-pi\"><img title=\"Tmp4a\" alt=\"Tmp4a\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16048970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Wipneus also sent me this two-week delta map showing changes in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago where the Northwest Passage main route is close to opening (ships are already <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,762.msg60761.html#msg60761\">taking on</a> the southern route through Bellot Strait that Roald Amundsen took in his legendary <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen#Northwest_Passage_.281903.E2.80.931906.29\">1903-1906 traversing</a> of the NWP):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a6bb970d-pi\"><img title=\"Tmp4b\" alt=\"Tmp4b\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a6bb970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Whether the main route opens up completely mostly seems to hinge on the question whether ice will clog up the western entrance at M'Clure Strait or not. My guess is it will be open all the way, from east to west, and yet again we'll see both the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage open at the same time. I guess that the people who like to dig through archives to show that current events in the Arctic have happened before, would've have flaunted some decades old newspaper article announcing the fact that the Arctic was circumnavigable, if it existed. So maybe, perhaps, possibly this is unprecedented and a sign that humans are rapidly changing the way the planet looks and its systems function?</p>\n<p>But to return to the update, here are regional sea ice extent graphs of the Central Arctic Basin and Eastern Siberia Sea, the two most important regions left:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16102970b-pi\"><img title=\"CAB and ESS\" alt=\"CAB and ESS\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16102970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>The East Siberian Sea was rapidly getting cleared of ice, but after weather conditions flipped and ice is being pushed outward again, the trend line has made a spectacular Sandy-like bend. Still, there is some potential left here, as there is in the Laptev Sea,on top of a small amount of piggy bank ice left in Baffin and Hudson bay. See Wipneus' <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://14adebb0-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/amsr2/grf/amsr2-extent-regional.png?attachauth=ANoY7cq_00mg2uoBPB_JmPQySK38ZsBZrcGT2Hu8M3_YMadBOn4XLWeEwD64aP8ZTBbPS-cG_pYMxTBsV002hfW3-ZS3uy3wUzlvgWvwQZyNczdb48IUGtowCfiiEfk6ZDjNFql5mRgs3_8wNqgztP5Pz9Z5GXwIK1UghBeHiam6agm0F6HCb3h_O2BidFJxBWfjAKsQgG0EK8WdWv76jIS02HV9WwK1NyWZfFccb1zT-qQFlQmtAwSPcaAx5sqIUHXCFLyilKVt&amp;attredirects=0\">regional graph</a> for all the details.</p>\n<p><span>Weather conditions</span></p>\n<p>Let's have a look at that shift in weather conditions, with the help of this animation of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://ocean.dmi.dk/english/index.php\">Danish Meteorological Institute</a> SLP images:<a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c161b0970b-pi\"><img title=\"DMISLP2015-6\" alt=\"DMISLP2015-6\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c161b0970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>What we see here, is what I like to call the neither-fish-nor-flesh set-up (young people might call it the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meh\">meh</a> set-up). There's no intense high pressure to deepen the ice's sunburn, but there aren't any mighty cyclones either to stir up the ice, bring up warmer water and flip ice floes (their bottoms are usually much darker because of algae). There have been a few short-lived cyclones in the past 2-3 weeks, but that's it, little movement, little compaction, little transport. The fact that trend lines have continued to drop instead of stalling (like happened in 2013 and 2014) is a sign that melting momentum has kept things going.</p>\n<p>The animation gets interesting towards the end, with a large high pressure area showing up on the Siberian side of the Arctic, leaning towards the centre. Let's see what the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsecmeur.html\">ECMWF</a> weather forecast model has in store for the coming 6 days (click for a larger version, and go to the ASIG <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts\">Forecasts page</a> for daily forecasts):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a8a0970d-pi\"><img title=\"ECMWF2015-6\" alt=\"ECMWF2015-6\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a8a0970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>The high pressure area stays in place, stays intense at 1030 hPa and stays big. A few weeks ago this would have totally destroyed the ice on the Siberian side of the Arctic, because that's what clear skies do for first year ice. But in this phase the Sun is getting lower and clear skies also mean a lot of outgoing radiation, which leads to lower temperatures (see temp animation below). At the same time the combination of this high pressure area with low pressure on the American side of the Arctic causes winds to further disperse the ice pack.</p>\n<p>The overall effect of this set-up will probably make it more difficult for this melting season to end up in the top 3, but might also cause some late havoc on the Atlantic side of the Arctic, where the first-year ice has seen little action this year. And of course it will push some more multi-year ice on the Pacific side towards warmer waters.</p>\n<p>When it comes to air temperatures, the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php\">DMI 80N temperature graph</a> makes clear that things will soon start to get colder (in the Central Arctic north of 80° first), but temperatures have been relatively high all summer with the trend line around and even above the average:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14b3b87970c-pi\"><img title=\"MeanT_2015\" alt=\"MeanT_2015\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14b3b87970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>When the trend line starts to make high jumps or stays way above the average, we'll know that a colder atmosphere is forcing the heat out of the sea surface so that it can freeze over. It's a bit early for that, although freezing temperatures are starting to show up as we speak. Temperature anomalies don't show this well, and so I return to actual temperature maps for the coming 7 days as forecast by the GFS model, provided by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cci-reanalyzer.org/\">Climate Reanalyzer</a>: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ab3a970d-pi\"><img title=\"Climate Reanalyzer T2-6\" alt=\"Climate Reanalyzer T2-6\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ab3a970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>It will take a while for these freezing temperatures to spread out, but the battle with melting momentum has begun. And one melting momentum factor is sea surface temperatures:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16557970b-pi\"><img title=\"DMI SSTA 20150819\" alt=\"DMI SSTA 20150819\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16557970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Plenty of heat on the Atlantic side of the Arctic that is going to get pushed along that front of homogeneous first-year ice, but less heat on the Pacific side to receive the floes that will be pushed towards it. The heat distribution is similar to 2013 around this time, but both 2012 and 2014 has most of their heat on the Pacific side of the Arctic (albeit 6 and 4 days later respectively):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ac41970d-pi\"><img title=\"Comparison 2012-2014\" alt=\"Comparison 2012-2014\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ac41970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>\n<p>Melting momentum (simply put, a combination of thin ice and warm sea surface temperatures) may keep that steady decrease going and there definitely is a lot of compaction potential, but it's mostly all down to winds now. Regardless of how it all plays out, 2015 will be another low year, with both passages possibly opening up again, and volume and multi-year ice getting reduced again.</p>\n<p>More will be known when the next ASI update at the start of September is published.

It's compaction rather than melting that determines the final shape of the ice pack, and compaction depends on which way the winds are blowing, which in turn depend on the constellation of cyclones and anti-cyclones, or high pressure areas. See this <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/end-zone-3-sea-level-pressure.html" target="_self">blog post</a> from an eternity ago, 2010, that explains how it works.</p>&#13;
<p>And now for the details...</p>&#13;
<p><span>Sea ice area (SIA)</span></p>&#13;
<p>Here's the latest <a href="http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/" target="_self">Cryosphere Today</a> SIA chart, to which I've added <a href="http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,1112.msg61082.html#msg61082" target="_self">preliminary data</a> as calculated by Wipneus:</p>

				 <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c17f8c970b-pi"><img alt="CTSIA20150818" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c17f8c970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c17f8c970b-800wi" title="CTSIA20150818"/></a><p>In the past two days the 2015 trend line has dipped below the daily minimums of rebound years 2013 and 2014. With 3 weeks in the melting season left to go I think it's safe to say that the rebound in the CT SIA data set has essentially been eliminated. The only question now is whether 2015 can still end up 2nd or 3rd. It's almost impossible to predict, as all the minimums are huddled close together. It might just as well come in 4th or 5th. Bottom line is it'll be low yet again.&#13;
</p><p><span>Sea ice extent (SIE)</span></p>&#13;
<p>With sea ice extent it's a slightly different story, as can be seen on this graph based on data from the Japanese <a href="https://ads.nipr.ac.jp/vishop/vishop-extent.html?N" target="_self">Arctic Data archive System</a> website:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a5ee970d-pi"><img alt="IJISSIE20150818" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a5ee970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a5ee970d-800wi" title="IJISSIE20150818"/></a>The trend lines are somewhat closer to each other, showing smaller fluctuations, and here the 2015 trend line will have to drop another 500K km2 to get below the 2013 and 2014 minimums. Some seriously favourable weather conditions will be needed for 2015 to make the top 3.</p>&#13;
<p><span>Cryosphere Today area per IJIS extent (CAPIE)</span></p>&#13;
<p>But the potential is there, if the CAPIE or compactness graph is to be believed:<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865c5cf970d-pi"><img alt="CAPIE20150818" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865c5cf970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865c5cf970d-800wi" title="CAPIE20150818"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>The CAPIE percentage is still among the lowest in the 2006-2015 period, lower than 2012 even, and this is in large part because of the heavy dispersal of the ice pack on the Pacific side of the Arctic, with a massive detachment of multi-year ice (I'll have more on that in a couple of days when all of the detached ice has melted out):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a662970d-pi"><img alt="Arctic_AMSR2_nic" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a662970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a662970d-800wi" title="Arctic_AMSR2_nic"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>If winds turn and push all that dispersed ice together towards the Canadian Archipelago, area and especially extent may go quite a bit lower. This is what made 2007 the record year it was, as winds blowing in the right direction caused heavy compaction in the final weeks of the melting season. Years like 2010 and 2013 didn't fulfil their potential because cyclones kept the ice pack dispersed until freezing temperatures started the process of ice re-growth and all the open water between floes iced over.</p>&#13;
<p><span>Regional SIE and SIA</span></p>&#13;
<p>In anticipation of that upcoming blog post on the detachment of an 'arm' of ice in the Beaufort Sea, its disappearance and the consequences for multi-year ratios, I can already show you the difference compared to two weeks ago, thanks to this fantastic map produced by commenter Wipneus who <a href="http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,382.msg60601.html#msg60601" target="_self">makes</a> his own sea ice concentration maps using the highest resolution AMSR-2 data (3.125 km grid) provided by the <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/new-map-on-the-block.html" target="_self">University of Hamburg</a>:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16048970b-pi"><img alt="Tmp4a" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16048970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16048970b-800wi" title="Tmp4a"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Wipneus also sent me this two-week delta map showing changes in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago where the Northwest Passage main route is close to opening (ships are already <a href="http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php/topic,762.msg60761.html#msg60761" target="_self">taking on</a> the southern route through Bellot Strait that Roald Amundsen took in his legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen#Northwest_Passage_.281903.E2.80.931906.29" target="_self">1903-1906 traversing</a> of the NWP):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a6bb970d-pi"><img alt="Tmp4b" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a6bb970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a6bb970d-800wi" title="Tmp4b"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Whether the main route opens up completely mostly seems to hinge on the question whether ice will clog up the western entrance at M'Clure Strait or not. My guess is it will be open all the way, from east to west, and yet again we'll see both the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage open at the same time. I guess that the people who like to dig through archives to show that current events in the Arctic have happened before, would've have flaunted some decades old newspaper article announcing the fact that the Arctic was circumnavigable, if it existed. So maybe, perhaps, possibly this is unprecedented and a sign that humans are rapidly changing the way the planet looks and its systems function?</p>&#13;
<p>But to return to the update, here are regional sea ice extent graphs of the Central Arctic Basin and Eastern Siberia Sea, the two most important regions left:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16102970b-pi"><img alt="CAB and ESS" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16102970b img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16102970b-800wi" title="CAB and ESS"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>The East Siberian Sea was rapidly getting cleared of ice, but after weather conditions flipped and ice is being pushed outward again, the trend line has made a spectacular Sandy-like bend. Still, there is some potential left here, as there is in the Laptev Sea,on top of a small amount of piggy bank ice left in Baffin and Hudson bay. See Wipneus' <a href="https://14adebb0-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/amsr2/grf/amsr2-extent-regional.png?attachauth=ANoY7cq_00mg2uoBPB_JmPQySK38ZsBZrcGT2Hu8M3_YMadBOn4XLWeEwD64aP8ZTBbPS-cG_pYMxTBsV002hfW3-ZS3uy3wUzlvgWvwQZyNczdb48IUGtowCfiiEfk6ZDjNFql5mRgs3_8wNqgztP5Pz9Z5GXwIK1UghBeHiam6agm0F6HCb3h_O2BidFJxBWfjAKsQgG0EK8WdWv76jIS02HV9WwK1NyWZfFccb1zT-qQFlQmtAwSPcaAx5sqIUHXCFLyilKVt&amp;attredirects=0" target="_self">regional graph</a> for all the details.</p>&#13;
<p><span>Weather conditions</span></p>&#13;
<p>Let's have a look at that shift in weather conditions, with the help of this animation of <a href="http://ocean.dmi.dk/english/index.php" target="_self">Danish Meteorological Institute</a> SLP images:<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c161b0970b-pi"><img alt="DMISLP2015-6" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c161b0970b img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c161b0970b-800wi" title="DMISLP2015-6"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>What we see here, is what I like to call the neither-fish-nor-flesh set-up (young people might call it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meh" target="_self">meh</a> set-up). There's no intense high pressure to deepen the ice's sunburn, but there aren't any mighty cyclones either to stir up the ice, bring up warmer water and flip ice floes (their bottoms are usually much darker because of algae). There have been a few short-lived cyclones in the past 2-3 weeks, but that's it, little movement, little compaction, little transport. The fact that trend lines have continued to drop instead of stalling (like happened in 2013 and 2014) is a sign that melting momentum has kept things going.</p>&#13;
<p>The animation gets interesting towards the end, with a large high pressure area showing up on the Siberian side of the Arctic, leaning towards the centre. Let's see what the <a href="http://www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsecmeur.html" target="_self">ECMWF</a> weather forecast model has in store for the coming 6 days (click for a larger version, and go to the ASIG <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts" target="_self">Forecasts page</a> for daily forecasts):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a8a0970d-pi"><img alt="ECMWF2015-6" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a8a0970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865a8a0970d-800wi" title="ECMWF2015-6"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>The high pressure area stays in place, stays intense at 1030 hPa and stays big. A few weeks ago this would have totally destroyed the ice on the Siberian side of the Arctic, because that's what clear skies do for first year ice. But in this phase the Sun is getting lower and clear skies also mean a lot of outgoing radiation, which leads to lower temperatures (see temp animation below). At the same time the combination of this high pressure area with low pressure on the American side of the Arctic causes winds to further disperse the ice pack.</p>&#13;
<p>The overall effect of this set-up will probably make it more difficult for this melting season to end up in the top 3, but might also cause some late havoc on the Atlantic side of the Arctic, where the first-year ice has seen little action this year. And of course it will push some more multi-year ice on the Pacific side towards warmer waters.</p>&#13;
<p>When it comes to air temperatures, the <a href="http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php" target="_self">DMI 80N temperature graph</a> makes clear that things will soon start to get colder (in the Central Arctic north of 80° first), but temperatures have been relatively high all summer with the trend line around and even above the average:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14b3b87970c-pi"><img alt="MeanT_2015" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14b3b87970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d14b3b87970c-800wi" title="MeanT_2015"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>When the trend line starts to make high jumps or stays way above the average, we'll know that a colder atmosphere is forcing the heat out of the sea surface so that it can freeze over. It's a bit early for that, although freezing temperatures are starting to show up as we speak. Temperature anomalies don't show this well, and so I return to actual temperature maps for the coming 7 days as forecast by the GFS model, provided by <a href="http://cci-reanalyzer.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Climate Reanalyzer</a>: </p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ab3a970d-pi"><img alt="Climate Reanalyzer T2-6" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ab3a970d img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ab3a970d-800wi" title="Climate Reanalyzer T2-6"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>It will take a while for these freezing temperatures to spread out, but the battle with melting momentum has begun. And one melting momentum factor is sea surface temperatures:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16557970b-pi"><img alt="DMI SSTA 20150819" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16557970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7c16557970b-800wi" title="DMI SSTA 20150819"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Plenty of heat on the Atlantic side of the Arctic that is going to get pushed along that front of homogeneous first-year ice, but less heat on the Pacific side to receive the floes that will be pushed towards it. The heat distribution is similar to 2013 around this time, but both 2012 and 2014 has most of their heat on the Pacific side of the Arctic (albeit 6 and 4 days later respectively):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ac41970d-pi"><img alt="Comparison 2012-2014" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ac41970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb0865ac41970d-800wi" title="Comparison 2012-2014"/></a></p>&#13;
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>&#13;
<p>Melting momentum (simply put, a combination of thin ice and warm sea surface temperatures) may keep that steady decrease going and there definitely is a lot of compaction potential, but it's mostly all down to winds now. Regardless of how it all plays out, 2015 will be another low year, with both passages possibly opening up again, and volume and multi-year ice getting reduced again.</p>&#13;
<p>More will be known when the next ASI update at the start of September is published. To close off, I can simply repeat this paragraph from the <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/07/asi-2015-update-5-late-momentum.html" target="_self">previous ASI update</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The rebound (or 'recovery', as some <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/20/arctic-sea-ice-volume-showed-strong-recovery-in-2013" target="_self">called it</a> prematurely) is in danger of getting wiped out, which brings us back to square -10, meaning that Arctic sea ice loss is still progressing much too fast.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Enjoy the Arctic sea ice, it's the only Arctic sea ice you've got.</p>
