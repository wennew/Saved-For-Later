                     <p id="p-3">Driven by a mysterious atmospheric anomaly, a 2-year-long drought has triggered a crippling water crisis in southeast Brazil,
                        a region of 85 million people that includes the nation's biggest metropolis, S達o Paulo. The S達o Paulo government has reduced
                        the water pressure in its mains, which regularly leaves faucets running dry. And it is now taking a carrot-and-stick approach
                        to water usage, financially rewarding those who conserve and fining those who waste. Barring a sudden reversal of meteorological
                        misfortune, officials are contemplating drastic rationing that would deprive millions of households of water for up to 5 days
                        a week. In a press conference last week, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences took state authorities to task for failing to take
                        bolder actions sooner and for a lack of transparency about the gravity of the situation.
