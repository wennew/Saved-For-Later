		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Uncertain climate system response has been raised as a concern regarding solar geoengineering. We explore the effects of geoengineering on one source of climate system uncertainty by evaluating the inter-model-spread across 12 climate models participating in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison project (GeoMIP). The model-spread in simulations of climate change and the model-spread in the response to solar geoengineering are not additive but rather partially cancel. That is, the model-spread in regional temperature and precipitation changes is <em>reduced</em> with CO<sub>2</sub> and a solar reduction, in comparison to the case with increased CO<sub>2</sub> alone. Furthermore, differences between models in their efficacy (the relative global mean temperature effect of solar versus CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing) explain most of the regional differences between models in their response to an increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration that is offset by a solar reduction. These conclusions are important for clarifying geoengineering risks regarding uncertainty.</p></div>
