		<b>Phytoplankton blooms on the western shelf of Tasmania: evidence of a highly productive ecosystem</b><br><br>Ocean Science, 11, 1-11, 2015<br><br>Author(s): J. Kämpf<br><br>Satellite-derived chlorophyll <i>a</i> data using the standard NASA-OC3 (ocean colour) algorithm
are strongly biased by coloured dissolved organic matter and suspended
sediment of river discharges, which is a particular problem for the western
Tasmanian shelf. This work reconstructs phytoplankton blooms in the study
region using a quadratic regression between OC3 data and chlorophyll
fluorescence based on the fluorescence line height (FLH) data. This regression is
derived from satellite data of the nearby Bonney upwelling region, which is
devoid of river influences. To this end, analyses of 10 years of MODIS-aqua
satellite data reveal the existence of a highly productive ecosystem on the
western Tasmanian shelf. The region normally experiences two phytoplankton
blooms per annum. The first bloom occurs during late austral summer months as
a consequence of upwelling-favourable coastal winds. Hence, the western
Tasmanian shelf forms a previously unknown upwelling centre of the regional
upwelling system, known as Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling
System. The second phytoplankton bloom is a classical spring bloom also
developing in the adjacent Tasman Sea. The author postulates that this region
forms another important biological hot spot for the regional marine
ecosystem.
