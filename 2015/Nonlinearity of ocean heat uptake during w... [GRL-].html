		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is expected to continue rising in the coming decades, but natural or artificial processes may eventually reduce it. We show that, in the FAMOUS atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, the reduction of ocean heat content as radiative forcing decreases is greater than would be expected from a linear model simulation of the response to the applied forcings. We relate this effect to the behavior of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC): the ocean cools more efficiently with a strong AMOC. The AMOC weakens as CO<sub>2</sub> rises, then strengthens as CO<sub>2</sub> declines, but temporarily overshoots its original strength. This nonlinearity comes mainly from the accumulated advection of salt into the North Atlantic, which gives the system a longer memory. This implies that changes observed in response to different CO<sub>2</sub> scenarios or from different initial states, such as from past changes, may not be a reliable basis for making projections.</p></div>
