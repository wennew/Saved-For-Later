		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Seven years of satellite observations (2003–2009) are used to describe variability in sea surface temperature (SST) fronts and in the alongshore component of ocean winds, and to investigate their relations in four Eastern Boundary Current Systems (EBCS). The general patterns of SST frontal activity are remarkably similar in all EBCS, with high frontal probabilities along the coast decreasing with distance from the coastline. Results from empirical orthogonal function decompositions reveal that the seasonal evolution of SST fronts and wind stress are significantly correlated, with intensified upwelling favorable winds associated with an increase in frontal probabilities. An offshore migration of the region of high frontal activity is observed during the period of upwelling favorable alongshore wind stress in EBCS. In all regions, the seasonal variability of frontal activity and wind stress is stronger at mid than at low latitudes. The width of the region of high frontal activity is relatively broader in the California and Benguela Current Systems, and narrower in the Canary and Humboldt Current Systems. The width of the band of high frontal activity may be influenced by multiple factors, including wind forcing, flow topography interactions and mesoscale dynamics. While seasonal variability in frontal activity in the California Current System acts to reinforce or weaken the average pattern, they are substantially different in the Canary Current System, where there is little overlap in the areas characterized by persistent and seasonally varying front activity.
