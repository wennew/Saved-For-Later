Realistic representations of stratification and bathymetry are used with asymmetric tidal forcing (including the steady South Equatorial Current which is assumed barotropic in the model) along a 2D transect aligned with the propagation direction of the wave signatures identified in the SAR. The combined flow (i.e. steady and tidal currents) is subcritical with respect to first-mode Internal Waves (IWs), but supercritical with respect to higher wave modes. Different types of nonlinear wave trains with distinct origins (i.e. tidal phase and location) have been identified with the combined aid of model and SAR: (1) large-scale primary mode-1 ISWs evolve from the disintegration of a multimodal baroclinic structure that appears on the upstream side of the sill; (2) mode-2 ISW-like waves that evolve from this same baroclinic structure and are arrested over the sill before being released upstream at the change of flow condition; (3) a large mode-2 lee wave is generated downstream of the sill (i.e. on the west side), which is trapped there during maximum westward tidal flow and released upstream when the tide relaxes; and (4) mode-2 ISW-like waves whose length-scales are O (20 km) appear some 50 km upstream of the sill, after an Internal Tide (IT) beam scatters into the pycnocline, itself originating from critical topography on the leeward (i.e. westward) side of the sill. The underwater sill being investigated is in the mixed-tidal-lee wave regime, where the internal tide release mechanism, lee wave generation and IT beams can coexist. The large-scale mode-2 ISW-like waves that form far upstream from the sill are long-lived features and can be identified in the SAR due to associated short-scale mode-1 ISWs which propagate with the same phase speed, i.e. in resonance. This coupling is also seen in the model, and here it is argued that the formation of those mode-2 ISW-like waves appears to originate from the IT beam after it reflects from the sea surface and interacts with the pycnocline, a generation mechanism referred in the literature as “local generation of ISWs”. This IW generation process may be easily overlooked and could be at work in many more regions of the world than previously thought.</p></div><p id="embeddedPDF"/><p id="SD_BA1P" class="sgfNoTitleBar sgfNoGadgetBorder svDoNotLink"/><h2 id="kwd_1" class="svKeywords">Keywords</h2><ul class="keyword" id="keys0005"><li id="key0005" class="svKeywords"><span id="">Internal solitary waves</span>; </li><li id="key0015" class="svKeywords"><span id="">Lee waves</span>; </li><li id="key0020" class="svKeywords"><span id="">Multimodal bore</span>; </li><li id="key0025" class="svKeywords"><span id="">Local generation</span>; </li><li id="key0030" class="svKeywords"><span id="">Mode-1 mode-2 internal solitary wave ressonance</span>; </li><li id="key0035" class="svKeywords"><span id="">Synthetic aperture radar</span></li></ul><hr class="artHeader"/><h2 class="svArticle" id="s0005">1. Introduction</h2><p class="svArticle section" id="p0030">The generation of nonlinear internal waves or Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) in the ocean is generally recognized as a complex phenomenon that after 40 years of research (see e.g. <a href="#bib47" id="bbib47" class="intra_ref">Lee and Beardsley, 1974</a>, <a href="#bib51" id="bbib51" class="intra_ref">Maxworthy, 1979</a> and <a href="#bib43" id="bbib43" class="intra_ref">Lai et al., 2010</a>) still remains a subject of active investigation. Some of the most common generation mechanisms of ISWs are associated with stratified strong tidal flows over large amplitude sills or submarine ridges, which generate ISWs close to the area of topographic interaction. These Internal Waves (IWs) are usually documented as nonlinear wave trains, internal undular bores, or ISWs, and may arise from the relaxation of internal hydraulic (supercritical) flows (<a href="#bib51" id="bbib51" class="intra_ref">Maxworthy, 1979</a>, <a href="#bib4" id="bbib4" class="intra_ref">Apel et al., 1985</a>, <a href="#bib10" id="bbib10" class="intra_ref">Brandt et al., 1997</a>, <a href="#bib25" id="bbib25" class="intra_ref">Farmer and Armi, 1999a</a> and <a href="#bib26" id="bbib26" class="intra_ref">Farmer and Armi, 1999b</a>), the release of internal lee waves (<a href="#bib36" id="bbib36" class="intra_ref">Haury et al., 1979</a> and <a href="#bib24" id="bbib24" class="intra_ref">Farmer and Smith, 1980</a>), intrusions created by collapsing mixed layers (<span id="bbib52"><a href="#bib52" id="ancbbib52" class="intra_ref">Maxworthy, 1980</a></span>), or some form of upstream influence (<a href="#bib6" id="bbib6" class="intra_ref">Baines, 1984</a>, <a href="#bib31" id="bbib31" class="intra_ref">Grimshaw and Smyth, 1986</a>, <a href="#bib53" id="bbib53" class="intra_ref">Melville and Helfrich, 1987</a>, <a href="#bib34" id="bbib34" class="intra_ref">Grue et al., 1997</a>, <a href="#bib15" id="bbib15" class="intra_ref">Cummins et al., 2003</a> and <a href="#bib43" id="bbib43" class="intra_ref">Lai et al., 2010</a>) – just to name a few generation mechanisms, which would clearly benefit from a unifying theory.</p><p class="svArticle section" id="p0035">A particular issue that has recently regained interest (see e.g. <a href="#bib70" id="bbib70" class="intra_ref">Scotti et al., 2007</a> and <a href="#bib43" id="bbib43" class="intra_ref">Lai et al., 2010</a>) concerns the ambiguity regarding the precise location (i.e either upstream or downstream) and tidal phase of the exact physical feature (i.e. isopycnal perturbations) from which IW trains eventually originate. While <span id="bbib47"><a href="#bib47" id="ancbbib47" class="intra_ref">Lee and Beardsley (1974)</a></span>, indicated as L.B. in what follows proposed that the IWs are formed on the upstream side of the sill that originates the disturbance, <span id="bbib51"><a href="#bib51" id="ancbbib51" class="intra_ref">Maxworthy (1979)</a></span> concluded that the blocking effect of an obstacle on an oncoming stratified tidal flow would only result in a quasi‐stationary lee wave on the downstream side of the obstacle, with a phase velocity opposite to the flow direction. This “lee wave” mechanism is based on the theory of supercritical flows, which uses the densimetric (or internal) Froude number (<em>Fr</em>, formally introduced later in  <span id="bs0025"><a href="#s0025" id="ancbs0025" class="intra_ref">Section 3</a></span>) to characterize the hydraulic state of a stratified flow (i.e. subcritical, critical or supercritical) with regard to the linear long IW phase speed.</p><p class="svArticle section" id="p0040">It is important to note that in <span id="bbib51"><a href="#bib51" id="ancbbib51" class="intra_ref">Maxworthy (1979)</a></span> the flow clearly reached supercritical speeds (<em>Fr</em>&gt;1 with regard to all IW modes) during a significant period of the experiment – which may not always be the case. This means that information can only propagate downstream (i.e. in the same direction of the flow), because the fluid velocity is greater than the IW phase speeds. During the accelerating phase of the tidal flow, when the Froude number reached a critical value (<em>Fr</em>=1), a disturbance on the interface (downstream of the sill) remains stationary and accumulates energy through resonance. Such a lee wave cannot propagate against the flow in the upstream direction until the relaxation of the tidal stream over the sill, i.e. when its phase velocity exceeds the slackening current. Subsequently, the pycnocline depression advances over the sill׳s crest and a packet of ISWs is formed. The model proposed by  <span id="bbib51"><a href="#bib51" id="ancbbib51" class="intra_ref">Maxworthy (1979)</a></span> successfully explained the generation of nonlinear IW trains in various regions of the world׳s oceans (see e.g.,  <a href="#bib4" id="bbib4" class="intra_ref">Apel et al., 1985</a> and <a href="#bib10" id="bbib10" class="intra_ref">Brandt et al., 1997</a>).</p><p class="svArticle section" id="p0045">Subsequent studies concluded that both L.B. and <span id="bbib51"><a href="#bib51" id="ancbbib51" class="intra_ref">Maxworthy׳s (1979)</a></span> mechanisms could apply depending on the flow criticality (see e.g. <a href="#bib36" id="bbib36" class="intra_ref">Haury et al., 1979</a>, <a href="#bib24" id="bbib24" class="intra_ref">Farmer and Smith, 1980</a>, <a href="#bib14" id="bbib14" class="intra_ref">Chereskin, 1983</a> and <a href="#bib50" id="bbib50" class="intra_ref">Matsuura and Hibiya, 1990</a>), although they have never been found simultaneously at work. We note however that the flow may be subcritical with respect to the fundamental mode but supercritical with respect to higher modes (e.g. mode-2). In this case, as reported by <span id="bbib24"><a href="#bib24" id="ancbbib24" class="intra_ref">Farmer and Smith (1980)</a></span>, a mode-2 lee wave is formed downstream while at the same time, mode-1 ISWs are also formed upstream of the sill׳s crest, in what appears to be an independent process. In this last case mode-1 ISW generation has been explained in terms of partial blocking and upstream influence, which is identified in state-of-the-art numerical models as the mechanism responsible for ISW generation upstream of several ocean sills (e.g. <a href="#bib15" id="bbib15" class="intra_ref">Cummins et al., 2003</a>, <a href="#bib70" id="bbib70" class="intra_ref">Scotti et al., 2007</a>, <a href="#bib76" id="bbib76" class="intra_ref">Stashchuk and Vlasenko, 2007</a>, <a href="#bib43" id="bbib43" class="intra_ref">Lai et al., 2010</a> and <a href="#bib11" id="bbib11" class="intra_ref">Buijsman et al., 2010</a>), even when the flow is supercritical (with regard to all modes) over the sill׳s crest.</p><p class="svArticle section" id="p0050">Another example of upstream influence has also been identified in the South China Sea (SCS) by <span id="bbib11"><a href="#bib11" id="ancbbib11" class="intra_ref">Buijsman et al. (2010)</a></span> who termed “internal tide release mechanism” to the generation of large amplitude ISWs from the asymmetrical flow across a large ridge (including tidal and steady currents). In this case, strong currents lift the isopycnals higher upstream of the ridge (i.e. creating an elevation wave there), allowing for a large energy density to accumulate on this side. As soon as the current slackens, this elevation wave is released upstream and ISWs form on its back slope – see <span id="bbib11"><a href="#bib11" id="ancbbib11" class="intra_ref">Buijsman et al. (2010)</a></span> for further details.</p><p class="page_fragment_ind" data-id="frag_3"/></div>
