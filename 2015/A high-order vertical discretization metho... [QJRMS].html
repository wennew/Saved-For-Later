		<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div><p>Applying finite element vertical discretization for a mass-based non-hydrostatic kernel is proven to be difficult due to the constraints of vertical operators. This article proposed a novel hybrid finite element vertical discretization method for the semi-implicit mass based non-hydrostatic kernel, which integrates a finite differential scheme and a finite element scheme together. In the hybrid method, the finite differential scheme which satisfies the set of constraints is applied to the linear part, while a cubic finite element scheme with high order accuracy is applied to the non-linear part. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the linear part, an enlarged set of vertical levels is employed to the differential scheme. This set of vertical levels is only used to solve semi-implicit equations, and has no impact on the grid point calculation and spectral transformations. A series of 2D realized test cases are conducted to verify the stability and the accuracy of our new method.</p></div>
