We used these records to identify high sea level events that had the potential to cause coastal flooding. This network consists of 43 operational tide gauges, and was set up as a result of the severe flooding in 1953. It is owned by the EA and maintained by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) Tide Gauge Inspectorate. We used data from 40 of the network’s tide gauges (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>); two sites in Northern Ireland (Bangor and Portrush), and Jersey in the Channel Islands were omitted. This is because the sea level exceedance probabilities (see description of second data type below) used to assign return periods to high waters, are currently available for only England, Scotland and Wales. The longest record is at Newlyn Cornwall, which started in 1915, and the shortest is at Bournemouth (Dorset), which started in 1996 (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>; <a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Newlyn has been maintained as the principal UK tide gauge since 1915 and is recognised as one of the best quality sea level records in the world<sup><a id="ref-link-section-26" title="Arau ́jo, I. &amp; Pugh, D.

The mean data length for all considered gauges is 38 years. At the time of analysis, quality-controlled records were available until the end of 2014. The data frequency prior to 1993 was hourly and from January 1993 onwards increased to 15-minute resolution.</p><figure><figcaption><b id="f2" class="block">Figure 2: Study sites and record lengths.</b></figcaption><div class="box pt10 pr9 pb10 pl9 add-top-margin suppress-bottom-margin no-line-below"><div class="text13"><a href="/articles/sdata201521/figures/2"><img src="/article-assets/npg/sdata/2015/sdata201521/images_hires/m685/sdata201521-f2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" class="block"/></a><p>(<b>a</b>) Location of tide gauge sites; and (<b>b</b>) duration of sea level records.</p></div></div></figure><figure><figcaption><b id="t1" class="block">Table 1: Names and locations of study sites.</b></figcaption></figure><p>The second type of data is sea level exceedance probabilities, estimated recently in a national study<sup><a id="ref-link-section-27" title="McMillan, A. et al.

Ocean Eng. 71, 28–39 (2013). " href="/articles/sdata201521#ref28">28</a></sup> commissioned by the EA. Exceedance probabilities, often called return periods/levels, convey information about the likelihood of rare event such as floods. For example, a 1 in 50 year return level is where there is a 1 in 50 chance of that level being exceeded in a year. We used these return levels to define a threshold for selecting high waters at each site, that were likely to have resulted in coastal flooding. In the EA study, a method, called the Skew Surge Joint Probability Method (SSJPM), was developed and used to estimate sea level exceedance probabilities at the 40 national tide gauge sites on the English, Scottish and Welsh coasts (and five additional sites where long records were available). A multi-decadal hydrodynamic model hindcast was used to interpolate these estimates around the coastlines at 12 km resolution. We extracted (using the information listed in Table 4.1 of McMillian <i>et al.</i><sup><a id="ref-link-section-29" title="McMillan, A. et al. Coastal flood boundary conditions for UK mainland and islands. (Project: SC060064/TR2: Design sea levels, Environment Agency, 2011). " href="/articles/sdata201521#ref27">27</a></sup>) the return levels for 16 return periods (from 1 in 1 to 1 in 10,000 years), for each of the 40 sites. By interpolating these 16 return periods, at each site, we were able to estimate the return period of each extracted high water.</p><p>The third type of data is a global meteorological dataset of mean sea level pressure and near-surface wind fields from the 20th Century Reanalysis, Version 2<sup><a id="ref-link-section-30" title="Compo, G. P. et al. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project. Quarterly J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc. 137, 1–28 (2001).

We used this data to track storms associated with the high waters that exceeded our chosen threshold (a 1 in 5 year return level). These data are available at a spatial resolution of 2° every 6 h from 1871–2012. 2013 and 2014 are not covered by the 20th Century Reanalysis, so we used a supplementary and similar dataset from the US National Center for Environmental Predictions/National Center for Atmospheric Research’s (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis, Version 2<sup><a id="ref-link-section-31" title="Kistler, R. et al.

These fields are also available every 6 h (since 1948) but have a horizontal resolution of 2.5°. For consistency, we spatially interpolated the data onto the 2° 20th Century Reanalysis grid. We used the data between latitudes 30°N and 85°N and longitudes 75°W and 20°E; the area where extra-tropical storms that track towards and influence the UK are generated.</p><h2>Stage 1: Deriving the high water dataset</h2><p>The first stage to create the database was to establish when high waters (that were recorded from the available records) reached or exceeded a threshold (for this we used the 1 in 5 year return level, for reasons explained below), at each of the 40 tide gauge sites. This identified events that had the potential to cause coastal flooding.</p><p>First, measured sea levels at each of the 40 tide gauge sites were separated into tidal and non-tidal components<sup><a id="ref-link-section-32" title="Pugh, D. &amp; Woodworth, P. Sea-Level Science: Understanding Tides, Surges, Tsunamis and Mean Sea-Level Changes. (Cambridge University Press, 2014). " href="/articles/sdata201521#ref31">31</a></sup> so that the relative contribution of tide and surge could later be identified. The tidal component is the regular rise and fall of the sea caused by the astronomical forces of the Earth, Moon and Sun. The non-tidal residual component remains once the astronomical tidal component has been removed. This primarily contains the meteorological contribution termed the surge, but may also contain harmonic prediction errors or timing errors, and non-linear interactions<sup><a id="ref-link-section-33" title="Horsburgh, K. L. &amp; Wilson, C. Tide–surge interaction and its role in the distribution of surge residuals in the North Sea. J. Geophy. Res. 112, CO8003 (2007). " href="/articles/sdata201521#ref32">32</a></sup>. It is for this reason that we estimate skew surge<sup><a id="ref-link-section-34" title="Compo, G. P. et al. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project. Quarterly J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc. 137, 1–28 (2001). " href="/articles/sdata201521#ref29">29</a></sup>, rather than the traditionally-used, non-tidal residual at high water. A skew surge is the difference between the maximum observed level and the maximum predicted tidal level regardless of their timing during the tidal cycle. There is one skew surge value per tidal cycle. The advantage of using skew surge is that it is an integrated and unambiguous measure of the storm surge. The tidal component was estimated using the freely available Matlab T-Tide harmonic analysis software<sup><a id="ref-link-section-35" title="Pawlowicz, R., Beardsley, B. &amp; Lentz, S. Classical tidal harmonic analysis including error estimates in MATLAB using T_TIDE. Comput. Geosci. 28, 929–937 (2002).

A separate tidal analysis was undertaken for each calendar year with the standard set of 67 tidal constituents. For years with less than 6 months of data coverage, the tide was predicted using harmonic constituents estimated for the nearest year with sufficient data.</p><p>Second, we extracted all twice-daily, measured and predicted high water levels at each site, as this is the parameter most relevant to flooding. To do this we used a two-staged turning point approach (described in the Technical Validation section). We then calculated skew surges from the measured and predicted high waters.</p><p>Third, we offset the extracted high waters by the rate of mean sea level rise observed at each site. This was in order to directly compare the joint probability of the skew surge and astronomical tide (i.e., extremity) of the high water events throughout the record, independently of mean sea level change. This is because the EA return periods are relative to a baseline level, which corresponds to the average sea level for the year 2008<sup><a id="ref-link-section-36" title="McMillan, A. et al.

Ocean Eng. 71, 28–39 (2013). " href="/articles/sdata201521#ref28">28</a></sup>.

When this is offset by mean sea level rise (mean sea level was 10 cm lower in 1948 compared to 2008), this high water actually has the largest return period at that site<sup><a id="ref-link-section-39" title="Wadey, M.

At each site, we calculated time series of annual mean sea levels, using the high-frequency records from the BODC, supplemented with additional annual mean values obtained from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level’s (PSMSL) archive (<a href="/articles/sdata201521#cite4">Data Citation 4</a>: The Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level <a href="http://www.psmsl.org">http://www.psmsl.org</a>).

We chose this threshold, because: (1) tides are large every 4.4 years due to the lunar perigee cycle<sup><a id="ref-link-section-45" title="Haigh, I. D., Eliot, M. &amp; Pattiaratchi, C. Modeling global influences of the 18.6-year nodal cycle and quasi-4.4 year cycle on high tidal levels. J. Geophy. Res. 116, C06025 (2001). " href="/articles/sdata201521#ref36">36</a></sup> and we wanted to ensure events arose as consequence of a storm surge and not just a large tide; and (2) it gave us a manageable number of 96 events in stage 2 (for example, selecting the 1 in 1 year threshold would have given more than 350 distinct events and a large proportion of these are unlikely to have caused coastal flooding). For each offset high water that was equal to or greater than the 1 in 5-year return level threshold, we recorded the: (1) date-time of the measured high water; (2) offset return period; (3) measured high water level; (4) predicted high water level; (5) skew surge; and (6) site number (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Across the 40 sites (for the period 1915 to 2014), 310 high waters reached or exceeded the 1 in 5-year threshold (the top 20 high waters are listed in <a href="#t2">Table 2</a>, sorted by decreasing the return period). In addition, we also stored information about the top 20 skew surges at each site. This Supplementary Dataset can be used to access storms that generated large skew surges, but which did not lead to coastal flooding because they occurred, for example, on neap tides.</p><figure><figcaption><b id="t2" class="block">Table 2: The top twenty high waters that exceeded a 1 in 5 year return level.</b></figcaption></figure><h2>Stage 2: Individual storm events</h2><p>The second stage was to distinguish distinct, extra-tropical storms that produced the 310 high waters that were identified in stage 1, and then to capture the meteorological information about those storms.</p><p>To distinguish storms and then assign each of the 310 high waters to one of these, involved a two-stepped procedure. First, we used a simple ‘storm window’ approach. We found that the effect of most storms that cause high sea levels in the UK typically last up to about 3.5 days. We started with the high water of highest return period, and found all of the other high waters that occurred within a window of 1 day and 18 h before or after that high water (i.e., 3.5 days). We then assigned to these the event number 1 (see <a href="#t2">Table 2</a>). We set all high waters associated with event 1 aside and moved on to the high water with the next highest return period, and so on. This procedure identified 96 distinct events.</p><p>Second, we used the meteorological data to determine if the our above-described procedure had correctly linked high waters to distinct storms. To do this we created an interactive interface in Matlab that displayed the 6-hourly progression of mean sea level pressure and wind vectors over the North Atlantic Ocean and Northern Europe around the time of maximum water level. On all but two occasions, our simple procedure correctly identified distinct storms. However, on 9–10 February 1997, the procedure identified one event, whereas, examination of the meteorological conditions showed that there were two distinct storms that crossed the UK in this period in close succession. Hence, we separated the high waters into two distinct events and altered the event numbers accordingly. In contrast, on 11–13 November 1997, our simple procedure identified two events, whereas there was actually only one event, associated with a particularly slow moving storm. Hence, we merged the high waters into one event, and altered the event numbers accordingly. Using this two-stage procedure, we were able to verify that the 310 high waters identified in stage 1, resulted from 96 distinct storms. For most storms, the 1 in 5 year threshold was reached or exceeded at more than one site, and in some cases two high waters exceeded the threshold during the same storm. The time and maximum return period for each of the 96 events is shown in <a href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><b id="f3" class="block">Figure 3: Water level events and data availability.</b></figcaption><div class="box pt10 pr9 pb10 pl9 add-top-margin suppress-bottom-margin no-line-below"><div class="text13"><a href="/articles/sdata201521/figures/3"><img src="/article-assets/npg/sdata/2015/sdata201521/images_hires/m685/sdata201521-f3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" class="block"/></a><p>(<b>a</b>) Return period of the highest water levels in each of the 96 storm events; and (<b>b</b>) the number of sites per annum for which sea level data is available across the 40 sites.</p></div></div></figure><p>Third, we digitized (using our interactive Matlab interface) the track of each of the 96 storms, from when the low-pressure systems developed, until they dissipated or moved beyond latitude 20°E. Different disciplines capture storm tracks in different ways. Because our focus is upon storm surges generated by the low pressure and the strong winds associated with storms, we captured the storm tracks by selecting the grid point of lowest atmospheric pressure at each 6-hour time step. From the start to the end of the storm, we recorded the 6-hourly: (1) time; (2) latitude; and (3) longitude of the minimum pressure cell; and (4) the minimum mean sea level pressure. For example, the storm track of the second largest event in the database is shown in <a href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><b id="f4" class="block">Figure 4: Example event.</b></figcaption><div class="box pt10 pr9 pb10 pl9 add-top-margin suppress-bottom-margin no-line-below"><div class="text13"><a href="/articles/sdata201521/figures/4"><img src="/article-assets/npg/sdata/2015/sdata201521/images_hires/m685/sdata201521-f4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" class="block"/></a><p>(<b>a</b>) Meteorological conditions at time of maximum water level at Portpatrick and complete storm track; (<b>b</b>) water level return period; and (<b>c</b>) skew surge levels; for the second largest event in the data record (3rd January 2014; event 2).</p></div></div></figure><h2>Stage 3: Coastal flooding</h2><p>In the third and final stage, we used the dates of the 96 events as a chronological base from which to investigate whether historical documentation exists for a concurrent coastal flood; using a similar approach to that undertaken for the Solent, southern England by Ruocco <i>et al.</i><sup><a id="ref-link-section-46" title="Ruocco, A., Nicholls, R.

" href="/articles/sdata201521#ref37">37</a></sup>. For each event, we searched a variety of sources for evidence of coastal flooding, including: (1) journal papers; (2) publically available reports and newsletters by interested professional parties such as the EA, Meteorological Office, local councils and coastal groups; (3) journalistic reports/news websites; and (4) other online sources (e.g., blogs, social media). In combination, these helped to establish whether coastal flooding occurred or not during the identified high sea level events.
