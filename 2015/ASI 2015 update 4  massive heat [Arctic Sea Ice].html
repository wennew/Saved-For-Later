Average decrease has been extremely low, with just 2 century breaks since May 1st. This may be about to change, as a 112K drop was reported today. </p>\n<p><span>Cryosphere Today area per IJIS extent (CAPIE)</span></p>\n<p>With area dropping relatively fast, and extent stalling, compactness will also drop fast. In these updates I refer to compactness as CAPIE, meaning Cryosphere Today area divided by IJIS extent numbers, a measure that was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/area-vs-extent.html\">invented</a> collectively back in 2010, when the Arctic Sea Ice blog first got underway (read the CAPIE segment in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2014/06/asi-2014-update-2-here-comes-the-sun.html\">ASI 2014 update 2</a> for a thorough explanation of what CAPIE actually is and what it tells us).</p>\n<p>Here's the current situation:<a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e41a970c-pi\"><img title=\"CAPIE20150706\" alt=\"CAPIE20150706\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e41a970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Despite a small uptick CAPIE is very low for the time of year. Because there isn't much divergence and transport happening, we can conclude that there is a lot of melt ponding going on right now. The only question is how much this will add to <em>melting momentum</em> for the remainder of the melting season. This in turn depends on where the melt ponding takes place, and how resistant/thick the ice is there.</p>\n<p><span>Regional SIE and SIA</span></p>\n<p>The regional compactness graphs produced by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home\">Wipneus</a>, part of the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/regional\">Regional Graphs</a> page on the ASIG, show us where the melt ponding is taking place:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e4a5970c-pi\"><img title=\"Regional compactness 4\" alt=\"Regional compactness 4\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e4a5970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>In the Chukchi Sea, of course, where almost continuous heat is causing so many melt ponds to form that the trend line has fallen off the chart. The neighbouring East Siberian Sea is also affected, and there has been a lot of melt ponding in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (as discussed in the previous <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/asi-2015-update-3-whats-it-going-to-be.html\">ASI update</a>), with all the leads and channels between the islands filled with bluish ice. This development has greatly increased chances of the Northwest Passage opening up again this year.</p>\n<p>Wipneus has sent me these custom-made regional maps that show the changes in the past two weeks (red = less ice than two weeks ago, blue = more ice than two weeks ago) in the Chukchi and ESS:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8789970d-pi\"><img title=\"Tmp4-1\" alt=\"Tmp4-1\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8789970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Two other regions of interest are Hudson Bay and Baffin Bay. The melt has been very slow there this year, but as these regions will melt out eventually, it essentially means that the 2015 melting season has a piggy bank. When this ice goes, area and extent numbers will decrease a bit faster and 2015 will likely drop down closer towards the record years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e592970c-pi\"><img title=\"Tmp4-2\" alt=\"Tmp4-2\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e592970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><span>Weather conditions</span></p>\n<p>Some of the heat I mentioned in the introduction, reaches the Arctic through the advection of warm air that formed over land masses, but most of it is caused by insolation. Solar radiation reaches the surface when skies are clear, and skies are clear where there is high pressure. With that in mind we look at sea level pressure (SLP) as displayed in this two-week animation of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://ocean.dmi.dk/english/index.php\">Danish Meteorological Institute</a> SLP images:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa759b970b-pi\"><img title=\"DMISLP2015-4\" alt=\"DMISLP2015-4\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa759b970b-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>This is what I refer to as the neither-fish-nor-flesh atmospheric set-up, where pressure isn't all that high or low. The lack of a pressure gradient leads to air standing still, so to say. And when the air stands still, the ice doesn't move. At the very end of the animation, however, we see a large high pressure system moving in via Greenland.</p>\n<p>High time to check out the 6 day forecast according to the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsecmeur.html\">ECMWF</a> model to see what's in store (click for a larger version, and go to the ASIG <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts\">Forecasts page</a> for daily forecasts):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e742970c-pi\"><img title=\"ECMWF2015-4\" alt=\"ECMWF2015-4\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e742970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>In the last ASI update I said I use Caps Lock sparingly, but I'm going to use it again: This high-pressure area is HUGE, huge in size, huge in high pressure, huge in persistence. In fact, I can't remember many instances of an intense forecast like this one, and I've been watching the Arctic intently for 5 full years now. A HUGE part of the Arctic sea ice pack - and let's not forget the Greenland ice sheet (see this <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://robertscribbler.wordpress.com/2015/07/06/greenland-melt-extent-breaks-50-on-july-4-2-standard-deviation-line-shattered-yet-again/\">blog post</a> by RobertScribbler) - is getting hit by a solar blast just two weeks after the solstice, and this will last days on end.</p>\n<p>But - and there's always a but - given the lack of cyclones and thus a pressure gradient, there still won't be hardly any movement or transport through Fram Strait. It's all happening in situ, just like last year, but with much more heat involved, as can be clearly seen on the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php\">DMI 80N temperature graph</a> with the trend line climbing above the average, something we haven't seen since 2012:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8b4e970d-pi\"><img title=\"MeanT_2015\" alt=\"MeanT_2015\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8b4e970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Other than the heat in the Central Arctic and the area from East Siberia to Alaska, there are also cold patches near the Kara Sea and Beaufort Sea according to the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/map/clim/glbcir.shtml\">NOAA/ESRL</a> 1-day anomaly map:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e93d970c-pi\"><img title=\"Sfctmpmer_01a.fnl\" alt=\"Sfctmpmer_01a.fnl\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e93d970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>So how about that heat in the coming 7 days? This is what the GFS temperature anomaly forecast maps provided by the excellent <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cci-reanalyzer.org/\">Climate Reanalyzer</a> website are showing: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133ec6f970c-pi\"><img title=\"Climate Reanalyzer T2-4\" alt=\"Climate Reanalyzer T2-4\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133ec6f970c-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Massive heat spreading all over the place, far into the ice pack. Truly massive. There's no other way to describe it.</p>\n<p>This will probably have an effect on sea surface temperature anomalies as well. Compared to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d12b6a80970c-800wi\">two weeks ago</a> there is still a lot of heat on the Pacific side of the Arctic (although in between the anomaly in the Bering Strait decreased substantially, I'm not sure why), with more and more heat being built up on the Atlantic side and in Baffin bay as well:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8f6f970d-pi\"><img title=\"DMI SSTA 20150707\" alt=\"DMI SSTA 20150707\" src=\"http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8f6f970d-800wi\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>\n<p>This melting season so far has been as slow as last year's, with little movement and transport of ice. But this time around there's much more heat in the system. The multi-year ice on the Pacific side of the Arctic has already had it tough so far, but is now suffering a major blow with open skies practically all over the Arctic bringing massive solar radiation and heat to the ice.</p>\n<p>Unless weather conditions shift dramatically, I don't see how this year can end up as another rebound. In fact, if this keeps up, the uptick in volume and multi-year ice since 2012 will be obliterated. It is also looking increasingly likely that both the Northwestern Passage and the Northern Sea Route will open up this year.</p>\n<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself, it's too soon to be drawing conclusions, with still two full months to go in this melting season. Nonetheless, I think it's safe to say there will be some hefty daily decreases in the coming week, which could be sustained for weeks to come if a lot of melting momentum is built up.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the Arctic sea ice, it's the only Arctic sea ice you've got.</p></div>","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1436270441000,"title":"ASI 2015 update 4: massive heat","published":1436270441000,"crawled":1436270579957,"alternate":[{"href":"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/07/asi-2015-update-4-massive-heat.html","type":"text/html"}],"author":"Neven","origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/atom.xml","title":"Arctic Sea Ice","htmlUrl":"http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/"},"summary":{"content":"During the melting season I'm writing (bi-)weekly updates on the current situation with regards to Arctic sea ice (ASI).

<p><span>July 7th 2015</span></p>&#13;
<p>I wanted to wait for the latest PIOMAS update and do another melt pond analysis for June, but given the current circumstances and the forecast I've decided to squeeze this ASI update in first.</p>&#13;
<p>As we've seen in previous <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/asi-update-2015/" target="_self">ASI updates</a> this melting season hasn't had a flying start, but it hasn't been as slow as 2013 and 2014 either. With extent going low real fast, but area lagging behind, the compactness numbers indicated little melt pond formation and no divergence to speak of. Melt ponds - and to a lesser extent openings within the ice pack - are important because they lower the ice pack's albedo and soak up a lot of sunlight, preconditioning the ice for further melting. This <em>melting momentum</em>, as I call it, can play a decisive role in the latter half of the melting season, trumping weather conditions.</p>&#13;
<p>Of course, weather still plays a very significant role in the final outcome of a melting season. This year hasn't seen any substantial preconditioning and is more similar to rebound years 2013 and 2014 than record years 2012, 2007 and 2011. In fact, this year has been very much like last year, in the sense that there is hardly any movement.

<p>Big drops have been alternating with small upticks, keeping the trend line near the upper half of the pack, but below that of 2013 and 2014.</p>&#13;

				<span>Sea ice extent (SIE)</span>&#13;
<p>Meanwhile, the spectacular stalling of the 2015 trend line on the SIE graph (based on data reported by the Japanese <a href="https://ads.nipr.ac.jp/vishop/vishop-extent.html?N" target="_self">Arctic Data archive System</a>) has continued:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa7211970b-pi"><img alt="IJISSIE20150706" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa7211970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa7211970b-800wi" title="IJISSIE20150706"/></a>Back in the beginning of June the 2015 trend line was well below other all the other years in the 2006-2015 period, but now it's almost highest. Average decrease has been extremely low, with just 2 century breaks since May 1st. This may be about to change, as a 112K drop was reported today. </p>&#13;
<p><span>Cryosphere Today area per IJIS extent (CAPIE)</span></p>&#13;
<p>With area dropping relatively fast, and extent stalling, compactness will also drop fast. In these updates I refer to compactness as CAPIE, meaning Cryosphere Today area divided by IJIS extent numbers, a measure that was <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/area-vs-extent.html" target="_self">invented</a> collectively back in 2010, when the Arctic Sea Ice blog first got underway (read the CAPIE segment in <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2014/06/asi-2014-update-2-here-comes-the-sun.html" target="_self">ASI 2014 update 2</a> for a thorough explanation of what CAPIE actually is and what it tells us).</p>&#13;
<p>Here's the current situation:<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e41a970c-pi"><img alt="CAPIE20150706" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e41a970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e41a970c-800wi" title="CAPIE20150706"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Despite a small uptick CAPIE is very low for the time of year. Because there isn't much divergence and transport happening, we can conclude that there is a lot of melt ponding going on right now. The only question is how much this will add to <em>melting momentum</em> for the remainder of the melting season. This in turn depends on where the melt ponding takes place, and how resistant/thick the ice is there.</p>&#13;
<p><span>Regional SIE and SIA</span></p>&#13;
<p>The regional compactness graphs produced by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home" target="_self">Wipneus</a>, part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/regional" target="_self">Regional Graphs</a> page on the ASIG, show us where the melt ponding is taking place:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e4a5970c-pi"><img alt="Regional compactness 4" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e4a5970c img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e4a5970c-800wi" title="Regional compactness 4"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>In the Chukchi Sea, of course, where almost continuous heat is causing so many melt ponds to form that the trend line has fallen off the chart. The neighbouring East Siberian Sea is also affected, and there has been a lot of melt ponding in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (as discussed in the previous <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/asi-2015-update-3-whats-it-going-to-be.html" target="_self">ASI update</a>), with all the leads and channels between the islands filled with bluish ice. This development has greatly increased chances of the Northwest Passage opening up again this year.</p>&#13;
<p>Wipneus has sent me these custom-made regional maps that show the changes in the past two weeks (red = less ice than two weeks ago, blue = more ice than two weeks ago) in the Chukchi and ESS:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8789970d-pi"><img alt="Tmp4-1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8789970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8789970d-800wi" title="Tmp4-1"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Two other regions of interest are Hudson Bay and Baffin Bay. The melt has been very slow there this year, but as these regions will melt out eventually, it essentially means that the 2015 melting season has a piggy bank. When this ice goes, area and extent numbers will decrease a bit faster and 2015 will likely drop down closer towards the record years.</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e592970c-pi"><img alt="Tmp4-2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e592970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e592970c-800wi" title="Tmp4-2"/></a></p>&#13;
<p><span>Weather conditions</span></p>&#13;
<p>Some of the heat I mentioned in the introduction, reaches the Arctic through the advection of warm air that formed over land masses, but most of it is caused by insolation. Solar radiation reaches the surface when skies are clear, and skies are clear where there is high pressure. With that in mind we look at sea level pressure (SLP) as displayed in this two-week animation of <a href="http://ocean.dmi.dk/english/index.php" target="_self">Danish Meteorological Institute</a> SLP images:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa759b970b-pi"><img alt="DMISLP2015-4" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa759b970b img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b7c7aa759b970b-800wi" title="DMISLP2015-4"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>This is what I refer to as the neither-fish-nor-flesh atmospheric set-up, where pressure isn't all that high or low. The lack of a pressure gradient leads to air standing still, so to say. And when the air stands still, the ice doesn't move. At the very end of the animation, however, we see a large high pressure system moving in via Greenland.</p>&#13;
<p>High time to check out the 6 day forecast according to the <a href="http://www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsecmeur.html" target="_self">ECMWF</a> model to see what's in store (click for a larger version, and go to the ASIG <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/forecasts" target="_self">Forecasts page</a> for daily forecasts):</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e742970c-pi"><img alt="ECMWF2015-4" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e742970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e742970c-800wi" title="ECMWF2015-4"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>In the last ASI update I said I use Caps Lock sparingly, but I'm going to use it again: This high-pressure area is HUGE, huge in size, huge in high pressure, huge in persistence. In fact, I can't remember many instances of an intense forecast like this one, and I've been watching the Arctic intently for 5 full years now. A HUGE part of the Arctic sea ice pack - and let's not forget the Greenland ice sheet (see this <a href="https://robertscribbler.wordpress.com/2015/07/06/greenland-melt-extent-breaks-50-on-july-4-2-standard-deviation-line-shattered-yet-again/" target="_self">blog post</a> by RobertScribbler) - is getting hit by a solar blast just two weeks after the solstice, and this will last days on end.</p>&#13;
<p>But - and there's always a but - given the lack of cyclones and thus a pressure gradient, there still won't be hardly any movement or transport through Fram Strait. It's all happening in situ, just like last year, but with much more heat involved, as can be clearly seen on the <a href="http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php" target="_self">DMI 80N temperature graph</a> with the trend line climbing above the average, something we haven't seen since 2012:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8b4e970d-pi"><img alt="MeanT_2015" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8b4e970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8b4e970d-800wi" title="MeanT_2015"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Other than the heat in the Central Arctic and the area from East Siberia to Alaska, there are also cold patches near the Kara Sea and Beaufort Sea according to the <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/map/clim/glbcir.shtml" target="_self">NOAA/ESRL</a> 1-day anomaly map:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e93d970c-pi"><img alt="Sfctmpmer_01a.fnl" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e93d970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133e93d970c-800wi" title="Sfctmpmer_01a.fnl"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>So how about that heat in the coming 7 days? This is what the GFS temperature anomaly forecast maps provided by the excellent <a href="http://cci-reanalyzer.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Climate Reanalyzer</a> website are showing: </p>&#13;
<p> </p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133ec6f970c-pi"><img alt="Climate Reanalyzer T2-4" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133ec6f970c img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d133ec6f970c-800wi" title="Climate Reanalyzer T2-4"/></a></p>&#13;
<p>Massive heat spreading all over the place, far into the ice pack. Truly massive. There's no other way to describe it.</p>&#13;
<p>This will probably have an effect on sea surface temperature anomalies as well. Compared to <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01b8d12b6a80970c-800wi" target="_self">two weeks ago</a> there is still a lot of heat on the Pacific side of the Arctic (although in between the anomaly in the Bering Strait decreased substantially, I'm not sure why), with more and more heat being built up on the Atlantic side and in Baffin bay as well:</p>&#13;
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8f6f970d-pi"><img alt="DMI SSTA 20150707" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8f6f970d image-full img-responsive" src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b01bb084e8f6f970d-800wi" title="DMI SSTA 20150707"/></a></p>&#13;
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>&#13;
<p>This melting season so far has been as slow as last year's, with little movement and transport of ice. But this time around there's much more heat in the system. The multi-year ice on the Pacific side of the Arctic has already had it tough so far, but is now suffering a major blow with open skies practically all over the Arctic bringing massive solar radiation and heat to the ice.</p>&#13;
<p>Unless weather conditions shift dramatically, I don't see how this year can end up as another rebound. In fact, if this keeps up, the uptick in volume and multi-year ice since 2012 will be obliterated. It is also looking increasingly likely that both the Northwestern Passage and the Northern Sea Route will open up this year.</p>&#13;
<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself, it's too soon to be drawing conclusions, with still two full months to go in this melting season. Nonetheless, I think it's safe to say there will be some hefty daily decreases in the coming week, which could be sustained for weeks to come if a lot of melting momentum is built up.</p>&#13;
<p>Enjoy the Arctic sea ice, it's the only Arctic sea ice you've got.</p>
