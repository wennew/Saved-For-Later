		<h3>Abstract</h3><div><p>Climate radiative feedbacks are traditionally defined at top of atmosphere (TOA); however, strong radiative feedbacks also occur at the surface, with profound effect on the surface heat budget and hydrological cycle. “Rapid responses” to radiative forcing also occur and may also be expected to affect the surface. This study evaluates surface radiation changes, using a combined Partial Radiative Perturbation-Gregory approach, under abrupt increases in CO<sub>2</sub> in a climate model.
