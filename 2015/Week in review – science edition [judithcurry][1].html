		<div><div class="comment-body"><p>This is my latest climate solar assessment with give and take with Willis ,on the WUWT web-site. </p>
<p>A quote from Willis, which is excellent.</p>
<p>Any natural regulatory system has bounds on the variations it can control, and there are events that could alter or destroy the regulation.</p>
<p>Second quote from Willis which is excellent.</p>
<p>Willis- The sun has no effect whatsoever on climate you are correct I apologize also to L svaalgard</p>
<p>Willis says below<br/>
 Eliza, I have never said that, nor anything even remotely resembling that. Those are YOUR WORDS, not mine.</p>
<p>I have to apologize to Willis for not listening to him carefully enough because if one really listens to what he is saying he is opened to solar, while also saying there are events that can destroy or alter the natural regulatory system of the climate.</p>
<p>So I have a starting point with Willis , which at one time I thought I did not have.</p>
<p>Another point we agree on is if the sun varies enough it will have an impact on the climate. Everyone submits to this ,the disagreement however, is not if solar variation will change the climate but does the sun vary enough to accomplish this?</p>
<p>This leads to my argument with Willis , which is the so called 11 year sunspot normal cycle is not where one is going to be able to find solar/climate connections, because the EXTREMES in solar activity are not strong enough in degree of magnitude or long enough in duration of time to have a climate effect. In addition the 11 year cycle going from weak to strong sunspot activity cancels the climate effect it may have before any significant impact could come about. </p>
<p>In other words thresholds can not be reached in the climate system due to these 11 year variations in solar activity. This is the wrong place to look if one wants to find a solar climate connection.</p>
<p>The place to look is when the sun enters an extreme period of prolonged minimum solar quiet and when one looks at these periods the data does show a climate/solar correlation to one degree or another.<br/>
 The problem is there are other factors superimposed upon even this extreme solar variability which although keeps the lower global average temperature trend in place there are periods of rising temperatures within the overall lower temperature trend.</p>
<p>Why ? Because within any global temperature trend initiated by solar variability one has to take into account the following factors; </p>
<p>1. all solar minimum differ as was the case recently with the 1996 solar minimum versus the 2008-2010 solar lull, which effects the climate in a different manner..</p>
<p>2. the stage of where earth is in respect to Milankovitch Cycles is either going to work in concert or against the current trend the solar variability is exerting upon the climate. Right now I would say Milankovitch Cycles are on balance acting in concert with minimum prolonged solar activity.</p>
<p>3. the geo magnetic field can enhance given solar activity effects or diminish given solar activity effects upon the climate. A weaker field compounding given solar effects.</p>
<p>4. land /ocean arrangements and elevations. Right now acting in concert with reduced solar activity very favorable for cooling.</p>
<p>5. the ice dynamic/snow cover which when at a critical stage can enhance or diminish the solar impacts. Right now not that favorable.</p>
<p>6. the rogue terrestrial event such as a super volcanic eruption or the rogue extra terrestrial event such as an impact could turn things upside down in the climate system.</p>
<p>7. this being very important which is the elusive thresholds which I think are out there but I do not know what degree of solar extremes are needed to bring them about, but there must be solar extremes that will bring them about. This is also probably tied into the initial state of the climate , for example point 5, which is to say just how far is the climate system of the earth from that inter –glacial/glacial threshold at the time the prolonged minimum solar conditions commence, which I think go a long way in the climatic effect the given solar variability will have upon the climate. .</p>
<p>8. the normal earth intrinsic climate factors which superimpose themselves upon the big general climatic trend regardless if they are associated directly with given solar activity or not.</p>
<p>9. Lunar input- which could possibly enhance or diminish given solar activity.</p>
<p>My best guess based on the historical climatic record is the solar extremes needed to have a clear climatic impact and not one that is obscured have to be slightly less then quote so called normal 11 year sunspot minimums but more importantly the duration of time has to be longer. </p>
<p>Once this is in when combined with the points in the above the climate result should come about, with the exception if point 6 were to take place. </p>
<p>Possible important (some) secondary effects due to solar activity which in turn can moderate the climate.</p>
<p>cosmic ray change moderates cloud coverage.</p>
<p>ozone changes moderates atmospheric circulation atmospheric.</p>
<p>geological activity moderation.</p>
<p>Any natural regulatory system has bounds on the variations it can control, and there are events that could alter or destroy the regulation.</p>
<p>Willis statement above one more time.</p>
<p>Willis says there are events that could destroy or alter this regulation my question to him is what are the most likely events that can accomplish this?</p>
<p>I am curious to know because so far on balance although he has not closed the door on anything to be fair, I have never heard Willis embrace any one particular item but that might be because it is elusive to him given the studies and research he has done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Willis, admits one thing or combination of things is out there that does have the ability to alter or destroy the climatic regulation.</p>
<p>For my part I think I am on the correct path through the process of elimination if nothing else and another point which favors an extra- terrestrial event governing effect upon the climate to some degree is the semi cyclic nature of the climatic system of the earth.</p>
<p>It is very hard to believe that random, chaotic earth bond intrinsic events in a system that is non linear to add insult to injury can somehow change over time in such a way to result in a semi cyclic beat to the climate. It seems highly unlikely.</p>
<p>Today is an example of how sunspot activity is deceiving when it comes to solar effects.</p>
<p>The sun is almost spotless yet we have coronal holes producing a significant geomagnetic storm.</p>
<p>For dramatic climatic events the solar wind /geo magnetic activity has to be low, in addition to sunspot activity. Sunspot activity does not tell the whole story, and coronal hole effects can linger well after sunspot activity has diminished. This is why duration of time is key in regards to solar minimum activity , not to mention the inherent lag in the climate system due to the oceans..</p>
