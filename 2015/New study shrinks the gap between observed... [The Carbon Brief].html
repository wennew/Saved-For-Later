<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sea surface warming</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The new paper's authors - a list of nine&#13;
researchers from UK, US and Canadian Universities - say the&#13;
discrepancy between modelled and observed datasets is at least&#13;
partly because they estimate global temperature in different&#13;
ways.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global temperature in climate model simulations&#13;
is typically calculated using only air temperatures, whereas&#13;
observational records are based on a "blend" of measurements taken&#13;
from the air above land and from the surface of the&#13;
ocean.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>When the team adjusted the models to be&#13;
consistent with the way observational records measure global&#13;
temperature, the discrepancy shrunk by 38% over the period&#13;
1975-2014 (blue line in the top panel above).</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Put another way, the trend in global temperature&#13;
from observation is about 0.017C per decade lower than it would be&#13;
if it was based on air temperature alone. The reason is that the&#13;
sea surface tends to warm more slowly than the air over the ocean,&#13;
the paper explains.</span></p>&#13;

This affects the global temperature estimate because the Arctic is&#13;

Hawkins</span></a> <span>from the University of Reading. The&#13;
University of York, where lead author</span> <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/academic/a-c/kcowtan/">&#13;
<span>Dr Kevin Cowtan</span></a> <span>is a researcher, has&#13;

<span>handy briefing</span></a> <span>explaining some other&#13;
differences the team noticed to do with how observations and models&#13;
deal with diminishing sea ice in the Arctic.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The past decade</strong></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you take just the past five years from&#13;
2009-2013, the new paper's adjustments reduce the discrepancy&#13;
between models and observations by less than over the longer period&#13;
between 1975-2014, by 27% compared to 38%.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are a number of reasons why observed&#13;
temperatures might have been lower than models expected over the&#13;
last decade or so, scientists say. It's thought the main reason is&#13;
natural cycles pushing</span> <a href="/blog/2014/10/an-in-depth-look-at-the-oceans-climate-change-and-the-hiatus/">&#13;
<span>more heat into the deep ocean</span></a> <span>rather than&#13;
keeping it at the surface.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Other contributions could be coming from an&#13;
increase in</span> <a href="/blog/2014/11/2015/01/how-small-volcanic-eruptions-may-have-contributed-to-the-hiatus/">&#13;
<span>small volcanic eruptions</span></a><span>, a reduction in&#13;
solar activity, a drop in water vapour in the stratosphere and an&#13;
increase in the amount of sunlight-reflecting particles in the&#13;
atmosphere, known as aerosols.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>The bottom graph above shows what happened when&#13;
the team adjusted their results to include an</span> <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n3/full/ngeo2105.html"><span>&#13;

NASA's</span> <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/gschmidt/"><span>Dr Gavin&#13;
Schmidt</span></a><span>. The modelled temperature (blue line) gets&#13;
even closer to the observations (black line).</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Interestingly, when the team took the most&#13;
recent decade and all its fluctuations out of their analysis, the&#13;
gap between modeled and observed temperatures was almost completely&#13;
eliminated, suggesting</span> <span>the</span> <span>discrepancy is&#13;
only very</span> <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7536/full/nature14117.html">&#13;

have been a better way to present the data. As it turns out, these&#13;
corrections help explain part of the apparent divergence between&#13;
the observations and models."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>So, which of the two approaches should we use to&#13;
get the best picture of global temperature?</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Scientist can't change the way Earth's surface&#13;
temperature has been measured in the past, says Hawkins. So, it&#13;
would make sense to adjust the model temperatures to be consistent&#13;
with the observations. He tells Carbon Brief:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr" class="quoteBackground"><span>"I think the sensible&#13;
approach is to extract the data from the models as if they were&#13;
observations."</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>Doing it the other way round - adjusting&#13;
observed temperatures to be consistent with models - is more&#13;
tricky, says Hawkins. The change would depend on the specific&#13;
model, since they would all slightly different in the corrections&#13;
they would apply.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr"><span>What's important, the paper notes, is to&#13;
recognise when a comparison between models and observed global&#13;
temperatures is an "apples to apples" one and when it's not, so&#13;
that we can make a fairer assessment of how well they're performing&#13;
against real world temperatures.</span></p>&#13;
