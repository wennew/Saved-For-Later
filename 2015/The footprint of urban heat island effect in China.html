					<h2>Exponential decay of the UHI effect along urban-rural gradients</h2><p>We showed that the UHI effect decayed exponentially and significantly with distance away from urban areas for majority of 32 Chinese cities, with the maximum temperature in the urban center and a temperature “cliff” between urban and rural areas (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#f4">Figs. 4</a>). This was similar to the findings in the United States<sup><a href="#ref17" title="Imhoff, M. L., Zhang, P., Wolfe, R. E. &amp; Bounoua, L. Remote sensing of the urban heat island effect across biomes in the continental USA. Remote Sens. Environ. 114, 504–13 (2010)." id="ref-link-50">17</a>, <a href="#ref18" title="Zhang, X., Friedl, M. A., Schaaf, C. B., Strahler, A. H. &amp; Schneider, A. The footprint of urban climates on vegetation phenology. Geophys. Res. Lett. 31, L12209 (2004)." id="ref-link-51">18</a></sup>. The decline trends were observed more obvious in summer than winter during the day, which can be mainly attributed to much stronger UHI effect<sup><a href="#ref10" title="Peng, S. et al. Surface urban heat island across 419 global big cities. Environ. Sci. Technol. 46, 696–703 (2012)." id="ref-link-52">10</a>, <a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-53">11</a></sup> and much more active convection together with the related circulation<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Oke, T. R. The energetic basis of the urban heat island. Q. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc. 108, 1–24 (1982)." id="ref-link-54">24</a></sup> in summer than winter during the daytime. On annual basis, although the maximum temperature difference were similar for the day and night (1.78 vs 1.59), the decay rate in the day was nearly twice that at night (1.30 vs 0.71), suggesting that the FP was much smaller in the day than at night as discussed further in following section.</p><p>Exceptions to above-mentioned patterns were also observed. One arid land-locked city (i.e., Lanzhou) exhibited an evident temperature decline trend, the “cold island effect”, along urban-rural gradients in the day during summer (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>). This is possibly due to the cooling effect (more heat being used for evapotranspiration) induced by the relatively higher vegetation activity and soil moisture (by irrigation) in urban and nearby buffer zones compared to rural areas<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S. &amp; Zhang, L. Spatiotemporal trends of terrestrial vegetation activity along the urban development intensity gradient in China’s 32 major cities. Sci. Total Environ. 488, 136–45 (2014)." id="ref-link-55">25</a></sup>. Moreover, two cities (Lanzhou and Tianjin) presented obvious decay trends of cold island effect toward rural areas during the day in winter. The reason for this phenomenon was not clear, but might be related to the air pollution<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-56">11</a></sup> and vegetation activity in this season. Heavy air pollution in winter for the northern cities resulted from large amount of coal burned for heating<sup><a href="#ref26" title="He, K., Huo, H. &amp; Zhang, Q. Urban air pollution in China: current status, characteristics, and progress. Ann. Rev. Energy Environ. 27, 397–431 (2002)." id="ref-link-57">26</a></sup> can decrease incoming short wave solar radiation in the urban area compared to the rural area<sup><a href="#ref27" title="Sang, J., Liu, H., Liu, H. &amp; Zhang, Z. Observational and numerical studies of wintertime urban boundary layer. J. Wind Eng. Ind. Aerod. 87, 243–58 (2000)." id="ref-link-58">27</a></sup>, which in turn might artificially reduce urban temperature and even result in cold island effect. Low vegetation activity in winter exerted little cooling effects on rural surface, where usually has more available energy than its urban counterpart during the day<sup><a href="#ref28" title="He, J. F., Liu, J. Y., Zhuang, D. F., Zhang, W. &amp; Liu, M. L. Assessing the effect of land use/land cover change on the change of urban heat island intensity. Theor. Appl. Climatol. 90, 217–26 (2007)." id="ref-link-59">28</a></sup>, therefore might result in urban cold island in those cities as well.</p><h2>Spatiotemporal variability of the FP across cities</h2><p>The footprint of UHI effect (FP) varied dramatically by cities (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#f6">Fig. 6</a>). As expected, the FP was larger provided with higher UHII and/or actual urban size, in particular at night (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#t1">Table 1</a>, <a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#f8">Fig. 8</a>). For example, the higher nighttime FPs in Northern China can be mainly attributed to the significant higher UHII in the region compared to southern cities<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-60">11</a></sup>. At the same time, the background climate influenced the FP substantially (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#t1">Table 1</a>), due to the climate control on the UHII<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-61">11</a>, <a href="#ref12" title="Zhao, L., Lee, X., Smith, R. B. &amp; Oleson, K. Strong contributions of local background climate to urban heat islands. Nature 511, 216–19 (2014)." id="ref-link-62">12</a></sup> and many thermodynamic properties over large areas<sup><a href="#ref7" title="Arnfield, A. J. Two decades of urban climate research: a review of turbulence, exchanges of energy and water, and the urban heat island. Int. J. Climat. 23, 1–26 (2003)." id="ref-link-63">7</a>, <a href="#ref8" title="Voogt, J. A. &amp; Oke, T. R. Thermal remote sensing of urban climates. Remote Sens. Environ. 86, 370–84 (2003)." id="ref-link-64">8</a></sup>. Larger FPs happened in colder or drier cities of China during the night in both summer and winter (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#f6">Fig. 6</a>), while the opposite occurred during the day in winter. These observations can be largely explained by the climate-driven UHII distribution in those time periods<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-65">11</a></sup>. Unexpectedly, smaller FPs were observed in some humid hot cities such as Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing during the day in summer (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#f6">Fig. 6</a>) although with relatively higher UHII<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-66">11</a></sup>. This phenomenon was likely caused by land use patterns<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Li, D. &amp; Bou-Zeid, E. Synergistic interactions between urban heat islands and heat waves: The impact in cities is larger than the sum of its parts. J. Appl. Meteorol. Clim. 52, 2051–2064 (2013)." id="ref-link-67">29</a></sup>. A strong contrast of land surface conditions (urban vs. vegetation) and thus energy balance<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S. &amp; Zhang, L. Spatiotemporal trends of terrestrial vegetation activity along the urban development intensity gradient in China’s 32 major cities. Sci. Total Environ. 488, 136–45 (2014)." id="ref-link-68">25</a></sup> can exaggerate the decay trends of UHI effect toward rural areas, and therefore dwarf the FPs. For example, rice paddy fields or other wetlands with no water limitation surrounding urban areas can have much higher evapotranspiration rates than urban land, thus the cooling effects of rural lands can sharply drop the daytime land surface temperature<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Hao, L., Sun, G. &amp; Liu, Y. Urbanization dramatically altered the water balances of a paddy field dominated basin in Southern China. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss. 12, 1941–1972 (2015)" id="ref-link-69">30</a></sup>. Further, other factors such as built-up intensity, topography, and landscape configuration may be also responsible for the FP’s variability. For example, the areas surrounded urban areas were usually covered by some built-up land. Higher built-up intensity in the area helps maintain warmer temperature<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Oke, T. R. The energetic basis of the urban heat island. Q. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc. 108, 1–24 (1982)." id="ref-link-70">24</a></sup>, consequently elevating the UHI effect and possible the FP of the city. Overall, the FP’s distribution appears to be more complex in the day than at night, most likely due to more complicated mechanisms underlying the UHI effect in the day than at night<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-71">11</a></sup>.</p><p>The FP differed greatly by time periods. The average FP equals to 2.3 times of urban area in the day, comparable to the estimates (i.e., 2.4) by Zhang <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref18" title="Zhang, X., Friedl, M. A., Schaaf, C. B., Strahler, A. H. &amp; Schneider, A. The footprint of urban climates on vegetation phenology. Geophys. Res. Lett. 31, L12209 (2004)." id="ref-link-72">18</a></sup> in the eastern North American. Yet it was significantly less than the FP at night (i.e., 3.9). The day-night difference can be attributed to the varying mechanisms underlying the day and night UHI effects<sup><a href="#ref7" title="Arnfield, A. J. Two decades of urban climate research: a review of turbulence, exchanges of energy and water, and the urban heat island. Int. J. Climat. 23, 1–26 (2003)." id="ref-link-73">7</a>, <a href="#ref9" title="Shepherd, J. M. A review of current investigations of urban-induced rainfall and recommendations for the future. Earth Interact. 9, 1–27 (2005)." id="ref-link-74">9</a>, <a href="#ref10" title="Peng, S. et al. Surface urban heat island across 419 global big cities. Environ. Sci. Technol. 46, 696–703 (2012)." id="ref-link-75">10</a>, <a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-76">11</a></sup>. For example, vegetation activity, cooling the Earth surface via transpiration, was one major driver for daytime UHI effect<sup><a href="#ref10" title="Peng, S. et al. Surface urban heat island across 419 global big cities. Environ. Sci. Technol. 46, 696–703 (2012)." id="ref-link-77">10</a>, <a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-78">11</a></sup>. Urbanization, replacing natural or semi-natural vegetation with impervious surfaces, often results in a sharp urban-rural temperature “cliff” in the day, therefore reduce the FP during the daytime. Comparatively, vegetation exerts weak effect on nighttime UHI because transpiration usually does not occur at night. At the same time, local convection and advection, suppressing the UHI and thus the FP, were much stronger during the day (particularly in summer) than at night<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Oke, T. R. The energetic basis of the urban heat island. Q. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc. 108, 1–24 (1982)." id="ref-link-79">24</a></sup>. Moreover, we found that the FP was larger in the summer than the winter during the day, most likely due to the overwhelmingly higher UHII in summer than winter during the day<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-80">11</a></sup>. By contrast, the nighttime FP varied slightly by season, which can be attributed to the small seasonal changes of the UHII at night<sup><a href="#ref10" title="Peng, S. et al. Surface urban heat island across 419 global big cities. Environ. Sci. Technol. 46, 696–703 (2012)." id="ref-link-81">10</a>, <a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-82">11</a></sup>.</p><h2>Possible UHII bias induced by ignoring the FP</h2><p>Our results showed that the UHII, if defined as the LST differences between urban and unaffected rural areas, was significantly higher than that between urban and suburban areas for nearly all the cities, in particular at night (<a href="/srep/2015/150610/srep11160/full/srep11160.html#f9">Fig. 9</a>). This led us to conclude that the UHII will be most likely underestimated if the FP was neglected. Further, the direction of the UHII estimates might be reversed. For instance, Lanzhou presented cold island effect (negative) compared to rural areas but weak heat island effect (positive) relative to suburban areas during the day. This can be attributed to the higher vegetation activity (cooling effects during the day) in suburb, followed by urban zones compared to rural areas over the city<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S. &amp; Zhang, L. Spatiotemporal trends of terrestrial vegetation activity along the urban development intensity gradient in China’s 32 major cities. Sci. Total Environ. 488, 136–45 (2014)." id="ref-link-83">25</a></sup>. In contrast, a weak heat island effect was observed in Xining compared to rural areas but cold island effect compared to suburb, possibly due to intensive agricultural practices in the rural areas, which led to higher vegetation activity compared with its urban and suburban counterparts<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S. &amp; Zhang, L. Spatiotemporal trends of terrestrial vegetation activity along the urban development intensity gradient in China’s 32 major cities. Sci. Total Environ. 488, 136–45 (2014)." id="ref-link-84">25</a></sup>. These together highlight the importance of considering city-specific FP when assessing the urbanization effects on local climate. Interestingly, the spatial variation of the UHII across cities under the two definitions were closely related, possibly because the large-scale UHII’s distribution was overwhelmingly controlled by the background climate<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Zhou, D., Zhao, S., Liu, S., Zhang, L. &amp; Zhu, C. Surface urban heat island in China’s 32 major cities: Spatial patterns and drivers. Remote Sens. Environ. 152, 51–61 (2014)." id="ref-link-85">11</a>, <a href="#ref12" title="Zhao, L., Lee, X., Smith, R. B. &amp; Oleson, K. Strong contributions of local background climate to urban heat islands.

Remote sensing of the urban heat island effect across biomes in the continental USA. Remote Sens. Environ. 114, 504–13 (2010)." id="ref-link-87">17</a></sup>, which differed slightly by how we define UHII for a city.</p><h2>Uncertainties</h2><p>Uncertainties remained in the results from this analysis. First, the FP might be underestimated in a few cities at night, especially during winters. We analyzed the UHI effect in the area extent less than seven times of actual urban area (including urban area) and assumed that the LST in the three furthest buffers can be considered as the unaffected references. However, our results showed that the FP reached up to 6.5 times of urban area for few cities, which was already the unaffected references defined in this study, indicating that the FP for those cities might be larger if we expanded the study area. We did not extend the research area in order to reduce the uncertainties associated with topography, land use, and the coupling UHI effect with neighboring cities. Second, two cities demonstrated cold island effect in the day in winter. We speculated that air pollution and low vegetation activity might contribute to this phenomenon, and direct observations are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, as mentioned above, many factors not included in this paper may play important roles in the FP’s distribution. We did not explore them in detail owing to the data and technique limitations. These together stressed the necessity of more efforts on exploring the FP via the combination use of observation, remote sensing, and physical-based models<sup><a href="#ref28" title="He, J.
