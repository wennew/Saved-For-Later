		<b>On studying relations between time series in climatology</b><br><br>Earth System Dynamics, 6, 389-397, 2015<br><br>Author(s): V. Privalsky<br><br>Relationships between time series are often studied on the basis of
cross-correlation coefficients and regression equations. This approach is
generally incorrect for time series, irrespective of the cross-correlation
coefficient value, because relations between time series are
frequency-dependent. Multivariate time series should be analyzed in both

cross correlation is low, the time series' components can be closely related
to each other. A full time and frequency domain description of this
bivariate time series is given. The AMO–SST3.4 time series is shown to
form a closed-feedback loop system with a 2-year memory. The coherence
between AMO and SST3.4 is statistically significant at intermediate
