In this coupled model, the main dependencies of weathering—runoff, temperature, and biological productivity—were driven from an energy-moisture balance atmosphere model and parameterized plant productivity. Long-term projections (1 Myr) were conducted for idealized scenarios of 1000 and 5000 PgC fossil fuel emissions and their sensitivity to different model parameters was tested. By fitting model output to a series of exponentials we determined the <em>e</em>-folding time scale for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering to be ∼240 kyr (range 170–380 kyr), significantly less than existing quantifications.
