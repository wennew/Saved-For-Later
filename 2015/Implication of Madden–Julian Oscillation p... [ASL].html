		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The Student's <i>t</i>-test was used to statistically prove the existence of a significant difference between mean values of several meteorological variables for the active and inactive phases of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) in the Eastern Amazon. The wavelet transform was used to identify 14 cases of the MJO occurrence, in which the analyses were performed. The analysis shown that the variables influenced by the convection such as outgoing longwave radiation, mean and maximum temperature, and insolation presented differences, between each MJO phase, at significance levels of 95% or higher.</p></div>
