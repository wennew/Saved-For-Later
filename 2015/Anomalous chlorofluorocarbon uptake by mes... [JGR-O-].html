		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The role of mesoscale eddies in the uptake of anthropogenic chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) gas is investigated with a 1/20<em><sup>th</sup></em> degree eddy-resolving numerical ocean model of a region of the Southern Ocean. With a relatively fast air-sea equilibrium time scale (about a month), the air-sea CFC-11 flux quickly responds to the changes in the mixed layer CFC-11 partial pressure (<em>p</em>CFC-11). At the mesoscale, significant correlations are observed between <em>p</em>CFC-11 anomaly, anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST), net heat flux, and mixed layer depth. An eddy-centric analysis of the simulated CFC-11 field suggests that anticyclonic warm-core eddies generate negative <em>p</em>CFC-11 anomalies and cyclonic cold-core eddies generate positive anomalies of <em>p</em>CFC-11. Surface <em>p</em>CFC-11 is modulated by mixed layer dynamics in addition to CFC-11 air-sea fluxes. A negative cross correlation between mixed layer depth and surface <em>p</em>CFC-11 anomalies is linked to higher CFC-11 uptake in anticyclones and lower CFC-11 uptake in cyclones, especially in winter. An almost exact asymmetry in the air-sea CFC-11 flux between cyclones and anticyclones is found. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>
