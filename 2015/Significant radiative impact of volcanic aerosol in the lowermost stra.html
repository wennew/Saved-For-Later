					<p>In addition to the Kasatochi eruption, the Sarychev and Nabro eruptions (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#t1">Table 1</a>) clearly increased the global stratospheric AOD between 2008 and mid-2012, both above and below 15-km altitude (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). At least four other volcanic eruptions also had some influence on the stratospheric aerosol loading in this period. The contribution of the LMS to total stratospheric aerosol is evident from a comparison of the global AOD calculated for the 15–35-km altitude range (the range used in almost all previous studies) and the total AOD between the tropopause to 35<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>km (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>).

	<p>To estimate the impact from the three largest eruptions between 2008 and mid-2012, the background AOD and radiative forcing during this time period were set to the values in the relatively quiescent periods between the Kasatochi, Sarychev and Nabro eruptions. Time integration over the elevated AOD during the three periods (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>) then provides the total influence (grey areas in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>) for the duration of appreciable impact of an eruption. From the integrated stratospheric AODs without and with the LMS included for the Kasatochi, Sarychev and Nabro eruptions, we found that altitudes below 15<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>km accounted for large fractions of the integrated AOD from these eruptions, namely 68, 54 and 41<span class="mb">%</span>.</p><p>Next, we estimate the fraction of the total, global stratospheric AOD attributable to aerosol in the LMS (<i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub>) over the entire 2008 to mid-2012 time period (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). The fraction is low (generally 20–30<span class="mb">%</span>) in periods between the three main eruptions. The <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> exceeds 50<span class="mb">%</span> 1 month after the Kasatochi eruption, and exceeds 40<span class="mb">%</span> after the Sarychev eruption. The Nabro eruption also yielded f<sub>LMS</sub> values &gt;30<span class="mb">%</span>. Our results for the years 2008–2011 show an average <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> of 30<span class="mb">%</span>. This result is at the lower limit of the previous estimate of 30–70<span class="mb">%</span> for the years 2000–2013 by Ridley <i>et al</i><sup><a href="#ref26" title="Ridley, D. et al. Total volcanic stratospheric aerosol optical depths and implications for global climate change. Geophys. Res. Lett. 41, 7763-7769 (2014)." id="ref-link-60">26</a></sup>. There are a number possible explanations for this finding. Ridley <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref26" title="Ridley, D. et al.

Lett. 41, 7763-7769 (2014)." id="ref-link-61">26</a></sup> estimated stratospheric AOD based on data from the AERONET network of sun photometers. Because AERONET does not provide vertically resolved AOD data, this method has to rely on a model of the vertical distribution of the tropospheric AOD to estimate the stratospheric AOD. The time resolution of this approach is also limited, and the AOD impact of individual eruptions cannot be clearly resolved<sup><a href="#ref26" title="Ridley, D. et al. Total volcanic stratospheric aerosol optical depths and implications for global climate change. Geophys. Res. Lett. 41, 7763-7769 (2014)." id="ref-link-62">26</a></sup>.The vertically resolved measurements from CALIPSO and IAGOS-CARIBIC permit a clearer separation between stratospheric and tropospheric AOD, and provide a new and independent assessment of the radiative impact of aerosol in the LMS.</p><p>In the following, we investigate <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> of the two hemispheres. The <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> is generally higher in the NH, and clearly shows an identifiable influence from the major eruptions (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). Three of the 4 years analysed display deep minima of <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> in July to August, with the exception of 2009 (which is masked by the Sarychev eruption). This annual minimum coincides with the minimum in size of the NH LMS<sup><a href="#ref16" title="Appenzeller, C., Holton, J. R. &amp; Rosenlof, K. H. Seasonal variation of mass transport across the tropopause. J. Geophys. Res. 101, 15071-15078 (1996)." id="ref-link-63">16</a></sup> and the summer flushing of the LMS with tropical tropospheric air due to the weakened subtropical jet<sup><a href="#ref17" title="Hoor, P., Fischer, H., Lange, L., Lelieveld, J. &amp; Brunner, D.

Res 107, 4044 (2002)." id="ref-link-64">17</a></sup>.</p><p>The SH was influenced by the eruptions of Merapi and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle. The SH <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> shows an annual variation pattern that is briefly disrupted in 2011 by the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle eruption. As in the case of the NH, the SH <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> has minima during all 5 years. These are evident in January to March, coinciding with the SH LMS minimum in size. The small influence from volcanism in the SH makes further investigation of the stratosphere–troposphere exchange feasible, because a large fraction of the stratospheric aerosol is formed in the Junge layer from carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The fraction of the LMS air that originates in that part of the stratosphere varies over the year, from ~60<span class="mb">%</span> in the winter spring to 20<span class="mb">%</span> in the summer autumn<sup><a href="#ref33" title="Hoor, P., Fischer, H. &amp; Lelieveld, J.

Geophys. 49, RG3003 (2011)." id="ref-link-66">34</a></sup>. With roughly 40<span class="mb">%</span> of the stratospheric air mass found in the LMS<sup><a href="#ref16" title="Appenzeller, C., Holton, J. R. &amp; Rosenlof, K. H. Seasonal variation of mass transport across the tropopause. J. Geophys. Res. 101, 15071-15078 (1996)." id="ref-link-67">16</a></sup>, we estimate that the LMS fraction of the aerosol-rich stratospheric air varies between 12 and 27<span class="mb">%</span> over the year. This estimate agrees well both in size and seasonal variation with our estimate of the observed <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub> of the SH, indicating that during background conditions the LMS holds ~20<span class="mb">%</span> of the stratospheric aerosol.</p><p>All of the volcanic eruptions studied here increased the relative importance of the LMS. We speculate that most volcanic eruptions affecting the stratosphere will probably induce such an increase. This is obvious for extratropical eruptions injecting SO<sub>2</sub> directly to the LMS. Tropical eruptions can also be expected to increase <i>f</i><sub>LMS</sub>. At background conditions, a large fraction of the stratospheric aerosol is formed from OCS in the deep branch of the Brewer–Dobson circulation at altitudes of 25–30<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>km, because intense ultraviolet radiation is required to oxidize OCS in a first step to form sulfuric acid aerosol. Formation of sulfate aerosol from volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> takes place also at low stratospheric altitudes, which increases the aerosol transport in the shallow branch of the Brewer–Dobson circulation having a shorter residence time than the deep branch. A shorter residence time of the aerosol before entering the LMS increases the relative importance of the aerosol in the LMS.</p><p><a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Figure 4c</a> shows the AOD of the SH and NH LMS obtained from CALIPSO LIDAR measurements, together with IAGOS-CARIBIC measurements of particulate sulfur. The IAGOS-CARIBIC measurements were taken in the NH, and were sampled in a strong concentration gradient arising from mixing of air across the extratropical tropopause. Because of this sharp gradient, the ratio to ozone (rather than the absolute concentration) is more representative of the volcanic additions to the LMS aerosol<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Martinsson, B. G. et al. Influence of the 2008 Kasatochi volcanic eruption on sulfurous and carbonaceous aerosol constituents in the lower stratosphere. Geophys. Res. Lett. 36, L12813 (2009)." id="ref-link-68">29</a></sup>. The IAGOS-CARIBIC measurements in proximity to volcanic eruptions exhibit large variability, which is subsequently reduced by atmospheric mixing. In contrast, the CALIPSO data are averaged hemispherically, thus smearing out small-scale spatial variability. This difference in spatial sampling is apparent after the Grimsvötn eruption, which causes a short but intense S/O<sub>3</sub> peak in the aircraft measurements, but has only a small signature in the CALIPSO observations. The effluents of that eruption were injected in the UT and the tropopause region, thus explaining the rapid decline and the comparatively weak response in the CALIPSO measurements. In addition, most of the IAGOS-CARIBIC observations were made at latitudes &gt;55° N, outside of the latitude limit for CALIPSO night-time measurements (see <a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Aside from this difference, the CALIPSO and IAGOS-CARIBIC measurements—which were made with completely different instruments—show similar temporal variability.</p><p>In the following, we investigate the contribution of volcanic aerosol in the LMS region to recent climate change. We estimate this contribution by calculating radiative forcing using AOD estimates integrated over both 15–35<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>km and the tropopause −35-km ranges (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4d</a>). Our calculations are a function of both season and latitude (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f5">Fig. 5</a>). As in the case of the AOD results described earlier, the radiative forcing is integrated for the Kasatochi, Sarychev and Nabro eruptions. We find that 56, 44 and 23<span class="mb">%</span> of the total radiative forcing from these eruptions originated from below 15<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>km.</p>

	<p>The relationship between AOD and radiative forcing is affected by a variety of factors, including the latitudinal and seasonal variation in cloud cover, surface albedo and solar zenith angle. The extratropical location of the LMS introduces a dependence of radiative forcing on the seasonal variation in the number of sunlight hours. For Kasatochi, a clear elevation of the LMS AOD (defined here as the time period when the LMS AOD exceeded 50<span class="mb">%</span> of its peak value for a specific eruption) lasted from mid-August to the end of October. The influence from Sarychev extended from mid-2009 until the end of that year. This implies that both eruptions had their main impacts approximately centred on the time of the autumn equinox. The dominant part of the aerosol from the tropical Nabro eruption was advected north; Nabro’s main impact on the LMS AOD occurred from the end of August to mid-February. Since this time of the year is characterized by few daylight hours, the radiative impact of the Nabro eruption in the LMS region was markedly reduced.</p><p>The eruptions studied here have clear geographical signatures (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150709/ncomms8692/full/ncomms8692.html#f4">Fig. 4e</a>). The NH extratropics were most affected by the three large eruptions described above, even in case of the near-equatorial Nabro eruption. A complete description of the volcanic aerosol loading from the total stratosphere, including the LMS region, will improve our understanding of the global- and regional-scale climatic effects of recent volcanic activity<sup><a href="#ref5" title="Santer, B. D. et al. Volcanic contribution to decadal changes in tropospheric temperature. Nat. Geosci. 7, 185-189 (2014)." id="ref-link-69">5</a></sup>. Such information will be useful for studies seeking to quantify the role of volcanism in the present ‘slow-down’ in global-mean surface warming<sup><a href="#ref2" title="Flato, G. et al. in Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis Cambridge Univ.

Our results indicate that inclusion of the LMS increases the global stratospheric AOD by 45<span class="mb">%</span> and global radiative forcing by &gt;30<span class="mb">%</span> during this 4-year period. This substantially increases the estimated radiative forcing and surface cooling. These findings provide considerable motivation for repeating CMIP5 simulations of historical climate change with improved estimates of AOD for the total stratosphere.</p>
