                    	<p>Limiting global warming to any level requires limiting the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, or staying within a CO<sub>2</sub> budget. Here we assess how emissions from short-lived non-CO<sub>2</sub> species like methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), black-carbon, and sulphates influence these CO<sub>2</sub> budgets. Our default case, which assumes mitigation in all sectors and of all gases, results in a CO<sub>2</sub> budget between 2011–2100 of 340 PgC for a &gt;66% chance of staying below 2°C, consistent with the assessment of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Extreme variations of air-pollutant emissions from black-carbon and sulphates influence this budget by about ±5%. In the hypothetical case of no methane or HFCs mitigation—which is unlikely when CO<sub>2</sub> is stringently reduced—the budgets would be much smaller (40% or up to 60%, respectively). However, assuming very stringent CH<sub>4</sub> mitigation as a sensitivity case, CO<sub>2</sub> budgets could be 25% higher. A limit on cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions remains critical for temperature targets. Even a 25% higher CO<sub>2</sub> budget still means peaking global emissions in the next two decades, and achieving net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the third quarter of the 21st century. The leverage we have to affect the CO<sub>2</sub> budget by targeting non-CO<sub>2</sub> diminishes strongly along with CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation, because these are partly linked through economic and technological factors.</p>
