					<h2>Site Location</h2><p>The Harberton bog (54.9 °S, 67.2 °W, 31 m a.s.l.) is one of the numerous mires located on the south coast of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, along the Beagle Channel. Mean annual rainfall is around 600 mm yr<sup>−1</sup> and mean annual temperature is 6 °C. The bog surface is dominated by <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i> with a sparse cover of <i>Marsippospermum grandiflorum</i> and <i>Empetrum rubrum.</i> The present-day landscape of this region was mainly shaped by outlet glaciers of the Upper Pleistocene Darwin Cordillera ice cap: the Beagle Channel and Lake Fagnano glaciers besides alpine glaciers from the Fuegian Andes. Upon deglaciation, peatlands developed in small lakes and ponds in local drumlin fields, such as the Harberton area<sup><a href="#ref15" title="Rabassa, J. et al.

Ch. 6, 129–144 (Elsevier B.V., 2006)." id="ref-link-81">14</a></sup>.</p><h2>Sample collection</h2><p>Peat cores were recovered from Harberton bog in 2012 by means of a stainless steel Wardenaar corer<sup><a href="#ref43" title="Wardenaar, E. C. P. A new hand tool for cutting peat profiles. Can. J. Bot. 65, 1772–1773 (1987)." id="ref-link-82">43</a></sup> for the top meter, followed by a stainless steel Russian corer (50 cm length; 10 cm internal diameter) for the rest of the core. A second overlapping core was taken in case the initial one would show signs of disturbances caused by coring. This core was, however, not analysed as we did not detect any disturbances in the master core. All cores were photographed, described and packed in plastic film and PVC tubes to be stored in wooden boxes for shipment to France. At EcoLab, the cores were frozen at −20 °C, unpacked and sliced at 1 cm resolution using a stainless steel band saw. Subsequently, each slice was cleaned with MQ water, edges removed and subsampled for further analyses. The thickness of each slice was measured using a vernier caliper, to calculate the loss of material due to each cut. An average loss of 2 mm per cut was calculated (=[total core length (1050 cm) – cumulative sample thickness (891 cm)]/Nr of samples (739)) and accounted for when recalculating the mid-point depth of each sample. All the samples were stored at −20 °C. One till sample was collected in 2005 from the terminal moraine of the Beagle Channel glacier at Punta Moat, in a cliff formed due to the marine transgression and in a section of the pedo-sedimentary sequence (85–90 cm) where no pedogenetic transformations were evident. Before sampling, 10 cm of the outer face of the sediment were removed to avoid contamination or modification by present materials/processes.

The best fit was obtained using a smooth spline (<a href="/srep/2015/150701/srep11670/full/srep11670.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. S1</a>). Based on 10000 iterations, minimum and maximum ages for 2 sigma confidence interval were determined for each sample.

First, each sample was freeze-dried and powdered using an agate mortar. Subsequently, 100 mg of each sample was acid digested in Teflon beakers. The following digestion procedure was applied to each sample<sup><a href="#ref49" title="Le Roux, G. &amp; De Vleeschouwer, F. Preparation of peat samples for inorganic geochemistry used as palaeoenvironmental proxies. Mires Peat 7, 1–9 (2010)." id="ref-link-89">49</a></sup>: (1) a mixture of 0.5 ml HF and 2 ml 16 M HNO<sub>3</sub> was added and left on the hotplate at 110 °C for 2 days; (2) 1 ml of H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> was added to react for 6 h at room temperature; (3) 2 ml of 16 M HNO<sub>3</sub> was added and left at 90 °C for 2 days to finalize the digestion. After each step, samples were evaporated to dryness. Finally, the samples were dissolved in 2 ml of 35% HNO<sub>3</sub>, transferred into 15 ml polypropylene tubes (Falcon®), and further diluted with Milli-Q water up to 14 ml. Major elements (i.e. aluminium, titanium, magnesium and potassium) concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; IRIS Intrepid II). Trace elements (strontium, gallium, rubidium, zircon, cesium, scandium, lead, thorium, uranium, hafnium, rare earth elements) concentrations were determined by quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent Technologies 7500ce) at the <i>Observatoire Midi Pyrenees</i> (Toulouse, France). The ICP-MS was calibrated using a synthetic multi-element standard, which was run every 8 samples, while an In-Re solution was used as an internal standard. The analytical performance was assessed by analyzing 3 international certified reference materials: SRM1947 (peach leaves), SRM1515 (apple leaves) and GBW-07063 (bush branches and leaves). The results are reported in <a href="/srep/2015/150701/srep11670/full/srep11670.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Table S3</a>. Measurements by ICP-OES of Mg, K and Ti were all within 10% of the certified values while the accuracy on the Al concentrations varied from 10 to 26%. The elements measured by ICP-MS were all within 15% of the certified values with exception of Sc (17%) and La (21%). The reproducibility of the digestion procedure, determined by repeat analyses of GBW-07063 (n = 10), SRM1947 (n = 7), SRM1515 (n = 3) and 6 peat samples (each n = 3), was generally better than 17%. The blanks for all elements considered here were &lt;0.01 ppm.</p><h2>Neodymium isotopic composition of peat and till samples</h2><p>Fifteen peat samples and 1 till sample were selected for neodymium (Nd) isotope analyses. To reduce complications associated with organic material during the separation process, 400 mg of bulk peat sample (100 mg for the till sample) was dry ashed in a furnace at 550 °C for 5 hours. Subsequently the samples were acid digested using a mixture of concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> and HF. The accuracy and reproducibility of the digestion procedure regarding Nd concentrations, determined by repeat analyses of the international certified standard GBW-07063 (n = 3), was better than 10%. Each sample was subsampled in order to make sure that a mass of 250 ng Nd was present in the sample that was loaded onto the columns.</p><p>Nd was separated from the matrix using a two-column ion-exchange technique. First, the rare earth elements (REE) were extracted from the sample using a cation exchange column (Bio-Rad poly-prep) packed with ~2 ml of Dowex AG50W-X8 resin (200–400 mesh). Then, Nd was isolated from the other REE by reversed phase chromatography<sup><a href="#ref50" title="Pin, C. &amp; Zalduegui, J. S.

Acta 339, 79–89 (1997)." id="ref-link-90">50</a></sup> using columns (0.4 cm inner diameter, 8 cm long) packed with Ln-Spec resin (50–100 mesh). Details on this separation procedure are given in <a href="/srep/2015/150701/srep11670/full/srep11670.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Table S4</a>. Procedural blanks were consistently less than 2 pg g<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>The Nd isotopic ratios were measured on a thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS) Finnigan MAT 261 (static mode) at <i>Observatoire Midi Pyrénées</i> (Toulouse, France). <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd ratios were determined as the average of 150 ratios normalized to <sup>146</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd = 0.7219 to correct for instrumental-induced mass fractionation. The international standard La Jolla (<sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd = 0.511858<sup><a href="#ref51" title="Lugmair, G. W., Shimamura, T., Lewis, R. S. &amp; Anders, E.

Measured values were 0.511851 ± 0.000006 (2σ, n = 3) which translates into an external precision of 0.1 ε<sub>Nd</sub> units.</p><h2>Dust accumulation rate calculations</h2><p>Dust AR (g m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) are calculated for each sample based on the REE concentrations measured in the peat samples using the following equations:</p><p>

L. &amp; Gao, S. in Treatise on geochemistry (eds Holland, H. D. et al. .) Ch. 3, 1–64 (Pergamon, 2003)." id="ref-link-92">52</a></sup>). Peat AR (cm yr<sup>−1</sup>) and density (g cm<sup>−3</sup>) are given in <a href="/srep/2015/150701/srep11670/full/srep11670.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Table S2</a> (excel file). The density of each sample was determined by measuring the volume using a vernier caliper and subsequently weighing the sample after freeze drying it.</p><h2>Principal component analysis</h2><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SPSSStatistics 20 software using a varimax rotation to reduce dimensionality within the dataset. Based on the co-variance between the variables (i.e. chemical elements in this study), a number of components are extracted explaining the total variance within the dataset. In practice this means that the components will contain elements that show similar variation, in this case similar concentration-depth profiles. Before analysis all data were first log transformed (log10) and subsequently converted to z-scores to account for the compositional nature of the data. The latter are calculated as follows z = (X<sub>i</sub>−X<sub>Avg</sub>)/X<sub>std</sub> with, X<sub>i</sub> the concentration of element i, X<sub>avg</sub> the average concentration of all samples for element i and X<sub>std</sub> is the respective standard deviation. Both transformations rescale the data and hence open the closed system of concentrations<sup><a href="#ref53" title="Baxter, M. J. Standardisation and transformation in principal component analysis, with applications to archaeometry. Appl. Stat. 44, 513–527 (1995)." id="ref-link-93">53</a>, <a href="#ref54" title="Baxter, M. J. Detecting multivariate outliers in artefact compositional data*. Archaeometry 41, 321–338 (1999)." id="ref-link-94">54</a>, <a href="#ref55" title="Eriksson, L., Johansson, E. &amp; Kettapeh-Wold, S. Introduction to multi- and megavariate data analysis using projection methods (PCA &amp; PLS). p. 490 (Umetrics, 1999)." id="ref-link-95">55</a></sup>. A varimax rotation is an orthogonal rotation to optimize the loadings of variables in the components, i.e. to explain the variance in the dataset by more homogeneous components. PCA was only applied to the oldest section of the record (from 7.1 to 16.2 cal kyr BP) because we are interested in identifying the source of the dust peaks occurring in this section of the record. Secondly, the overall concentrations in the youngest part of the core are very low which would give a lot of noise to the data set and thus PCA outcome. The result of the PCA analysis is shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150701/srep11670/full/srep11670.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. S2</a>.</p>
