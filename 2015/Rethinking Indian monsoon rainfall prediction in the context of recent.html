					<h2>Performance of dynamical predictions</h2><p>The recent low skill of AIRI prediction is not only seen in operational statistical models but also found in dynamical predictions of the state-of-the-art global-coupled climate models. We have examined five climate models that participated in ENSEMBLE project<sup><a href="#ref15" title="Weisheimer, A. et al. ENSEMBLES: a new multi-model ensemble for seasonal-to-annual predictions: skill and progress beyond DEMETER in forecasting tropical Pacific SSTs. Geophys. Res. Lett. 36, L21711 (2009)." id="ref-link-17">15</a></sup> for the 46 years (1960–2005) and four climate models that participated in the APCC/CliPAS project<sup><a href="#ref16" title="Wang, B. et al. Advance and prospectus of seasonal prediction: assessment of the APCC/CliPAS 14-model ensemble retrospective seasonal prediction (1980-2004). Clim. Dyn. 33, 93-117 (2009)." id="ref-link-18">16</a></sup> for the 27 years (1982–2008; see Methods). The hindcast correlation skill for the five ENSEMBLE models’ MME is 0.09 for 1989–2005 and the four APCC/CliPAS models’ MME skill is 0.24 for 1989–2005 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Interestingly, the APCC/CliPAS MME and the ENSEMBLE models’ MME have the similar performance: the correlation coefficient between the two MMEs’ hindcasts of AIRI for 1989–2005 is 0.87, suggesting that the current dynamical models capture similar sources of predictability. Both MMEs also show systematic biases in the climatological mean and year-to-year variance compared with observations (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>), indicating the necessity for a mean bias correction and variance inflation in practical dynamic forecast.</p><p>However, we also find that the ENSEMBLE MME hindcast of AIRI has a good skill of 0.63 for the earlier period from 1960 to 1988 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>). The results here imply that the recent failure of the ISMR prediction reflects secular changes in the prediction skills, a more reliable validation of the dynamical models’ performance may need hindcast data longer than 40–50 years, and a more reliable estimation of the monsoon rainfall predictability may need centennial hindcast data.</p><h2>Physically motivated empirical model</h2><p>To estimate the predictability of the AIRI using as-long-as-possible retrospective prediction, we developed a physically motivated empirical (P–E) model using the data from 1900 to 1988, and performed a 92-year independent retrospective prediction using data from 1871 to 2012 (see Methods). The P–E model was established based on an understanding of the physical processes linking predictors and the predictand. Statistical tests are used as an auxiliary tool to maximize the predictors–predictand correlation in training periods and to confirm their significance and ascertain mutual independence among the predictors. On the basis of physical considerations, rather than fishing statistical predictors, we confine the predictor search in only two fields, sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) and only two types of precursors, that is, persistence signals in spring and tendency signals across spring. The former often hint maintenance of anomalies due to positive atmosphere–ocean–land interaction processes, while the latter indicates the direction of the anomaly development. This physically motivated searching principle makes the selection procedure objective and easy to apply to other climate prediction problems. For AIRI, only four correlation maps were examined (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>); the April–May mean SST is not used owing to its high correlation with the April–May mean SLP.</p>

	<h2>Mining new predictors for AIRI</h2><p>It is well known that the ISMR variations are primarily driven by eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)<sup><a href="#ref17" title="Rasmusson, E. M. &amp; Carpenter, T. H. Variations in tropical sea surface temperature and surface wind fields associated with the southern oscillation/El Nino. Mon. Wea. Rev. 110, 354-384 (1982)." id="ref-link-19">17</a></sup> through tropical teleconnection<sup><a href="#ref6" title="Blanford, H. F. On the Connexion of the Himalaya snowfall with dry winds and seasons of drought in India. Proc. R. Soc. London 37, 3-22 (1884)." id="ref-link-20">6</a>, <a href="#ref9" title="Charney, J. G. &amp; Shukla, J. Predictability of monsoons. In Monsoon Dynamics 99-109Cambridge Univ. Press (1981)." id="ref-link-21">9</a>, <a href="#ref10" title="Shukla, J. &amp; Mooley, D. A. Empirical prediction of the summer monsoon rainfall over India. Mon. Wea. Rev. 115, 695-704 (1987)." id="ref-link-22">10</a>, <a href="#ref11" title="Webster, P. J. et al. Monsoons: processes, predictability, and the prospects for prediction. J. Geophys. Res. 103, 14451-14510 (1998)." id="ref-link-23">11</a></sup>. Traditionally, the April–May Nino 3 or Nino 3.4 SST anomaly was used as a persistent predictor. However, we use an east–west-oriented SST tendency as a new predictor because the EP–ENSO develops through Bjerknes feedback<sup><a href="#ref18" title="Bjerknes, J. Atmospheric teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific. Mon. Wea. Rev. 97, 163-172 (1969)." id="ref-link-24">18</a></sup>, that is, the equatorial zonal wind-SST gradient feedback through changing oceanic thermocline depth and upwelling<sup><a href="#ref19" title="Cane, M. A., Zebiak, S. E. &amp; Dolan, S. C. Experimental forecasts of El Nino. Nature 321, 827-832 (1986)." id="ref-link-25">19</a></sup>. This positive Bjerknes feedback can be captured well by the Pacific east–west dipolar SST tendency from March to May (denoted by EPT, <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#t1">Table 1</a> and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>). For instance, a cooling tendency during spring in the equatorial EP (and/or a warming in the equatorial western Pacific) signifies an enhanced east–west thermal contrast and associated pressure gradients in the ensuing summer, which enhances equatorial easterly that further strengthens upwelling in the EP, leading to development of an EP La Nina. Thus, EPT connotes a growing cold phase of EP–ENSO<sup><a href="#ref18" title="Bjerknes, J. Atmospheric teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific. Mon. Wea. Rev. 97, 163-172 (1969)." id="ref-link-26">18</a></sup> event in the ensuing summer (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). Note that the selected boxes also maximize the correlation of EPT with the AIRI. Other significant signals in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a> are not independent from the EPT.</p>

	<p>Given the recent weakening of the AIRI and EP–ENSO relationship<sup><a href="#ref20" title="Kumar, K. K., Rajagopalan, B. &amp; Cane, M. A. On the weakening relationship between the Indian monsoon and ENSO. Science 284, 2156-2159 (1999)." id="ref-link-27">20</a></sup>, it remains a great challenge to find new sources of predictability that can foresee the pathway leading to development of the diversity of ENSO and the Asian land surface pressure anomalies.</p><p>The central-Pacific (CP)-ENSO<sup><a href="#ref21" title="Ashok, K., Behera, S. K., Rao, S. A., Weng, H. &amp; Yamagata, T. El Nino Modoki and its possible teleconnection. J. Geophys. Res: Oceans 112, C11007 (2007)." id="ref-link-28">21</a>, <a href="#ref22" title="Kug, J. S., Jin, F. F. &amp; An, S. I. Two types of El Nino events: cold tongue El Nino and warm pool El Nino. J. Clim. 22, 1499-1515 (2009)." id="ref-link-29">22</a></sup> has recently been found to have conspicuous impact on ISMR<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Kumar, K. K., Rajagopalan, B., Hoerling, M., Bates, G. &amp; Cane, M. Unraveling the Mystery of Indian Monsoon Failure During El Nino. Science 314, 115-119 (2006)." id="ref-link-30">23</a></sup> but no predictor has been proposed. A CP–ENSO develops mainly through zonal advection by ocean currents<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Kug, J. S., Jin, F. F. &amp; An, S. I. Two types of El Nino events: cold tongue El Nino and warm pool El Nino. J. Clim. 22, 1499-1515 (2009)." id="ref-link-31">22</a></sup>. To capture this mechanism, we look for the north–south dipolar SST tendency in the CP (denoted by CPT, <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#t1">Table 1</a> and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2b</a>) that signifies ensuing southern warming–northern cooling in the CP. The north–south SST contrast further strengthens northward pressure gradients and associated equatorial easterlies and westward ocean currents, leading to a cold phase of CP–ENSO (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f3">Fig. 3b</a>). Considering the numbers of SST observations (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>), the location of the northern box for CPT was slightly shifted eastward towards the CP ship tracks. Note that the selected northern box does not maximize the correlation, but it is selected because of its clear physical meaning. The May minus April SST tendency used here is better than May minus March tendency because the CP–ENSO tends to develop later in the spring and has a shorter life span compared with the EP–ENSO. Although the maximum correlation regions on this map are located in the equatorial western and EP, they were not selected because of their dependence on the EPT predictor.</p><p>The mega-ENSO<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Wang, B. et al. Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon intensified by mega-El Nino/southern oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 110, 5347-5352 (2013)." id="ref-link-32">24</a></sup>, which has a pattern similar to Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Power, S., Casey, T., Folland, C., Colman, A. &amp; Mehta, V. Inter-decadal modulation of the impact of ENSO on Australia. Clim. Dyn. 15, 319-324 (1999)." id="ref-link-33">25</a></sup> but involves both interannual and multi-decadal variations of the Pacific basin-wide SST variability, has been recently identified as a major driver for the northern hemisphere monsoon rainfall variations including the ISMR<sup><a href="#ref24" title="Wang, B. et al. Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon intensified by mega-El Nino/southern oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 110, 5347-5352 (2013)." id="ref-link-34">24</a></sup>. The mega-ENSO involves an off-equatorial atmosphere–ocean thermodynamic feedback between the two Pacific subtropical highs (PSHs)/trades and basin-wide SST anomalies<sup><a href="#ref26" title="Clement, A., DiNezio, P. &amp; Deser, C. Rethinking the ocean/'s role in the Southern Oscillation. J. Clim. 24, 4056-4072 (2011)." id="ref-link-35">26</a></sup>. Thus, we define a PSH predictor (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#t1">Table 1</a> and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2c</a>) that gauges the anomalous intensity of the two PSHs during April and May that can foreshadow intensification of a mega-ENSO event (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f3">Fig. 3c</a>). Thus, the predictor PSH serves as a mega-ENSO predictor. Coincidently, the two boxes in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2c</a> also maximize the PSH correlation with AIRI. Note also that all three ENSO-related spring predictors are well correlated with not only the JJAS growing ENSO (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>) but also the corresponding mature ENSO anomalies in ensuing October through December (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>).</p><p>In addition to the abovementioned three ENSO-related predictors, an enhanced ISMR is accompanied by an abnormal low pressure over Asian continent. To presage the development of abnormal Asian low, we focus on spring SLP over North Asia (NA). We found that the decreasing SLP tendency from March to May in the vicinity of Siberian High pressure centre near the Lake of Baikal (NAT, <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#t1">Table 1</a>, <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2d</a>) represents a spring warming and low SLP anomaly over the entire Asian continent (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 3a</a>). The largest correlation over the eastern tropical Pacific in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f2">Fig. 2d</a> was not selected because of its high correlation with the predictor EPT. The NAT foreshadows the establishment of an anomalous Asian Low in the following summer that enhances the southwest monsoon rainfall over India (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 3b</a>).</p><p>None of the above four predictors used in the present P–E model was not used by IMD prediction system (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>). The three new ENSO-related predictors have distinctive periodicities (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5</a>): the EPT has quasi-biennial and quasi-quadrennial periodicities; the CPT has 3–4-, 8- and 20-year cycles; and the PSH has significant quasi-biennial and multi-decadal (60 year) peaks. Thus, they reflect different flavours of ENSO development that make complementary contributions to ISMR prediction on different timescales. The new land predictor NAT peaks on quasi-biennial and 10-year periodicities, which, to some extent, differs from the three ENSO-related predictors.</p><h2>Prediction skill of the P–E model</h2><p>The above four complementary predictors are physically connected to and significantly correlated with the AIRI using the data from 1900 to 1988 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#t2">Table 2</a>). These predictors reflecting different physical processes are used to build prediction equations. Since reliable estimation of the practical predictability requires centennial independent retrospective forecasts, we developed a suite of progression (forward rolling) multi-regression prediction equations using the same four predictors (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#t1">Table 1</a>) and 142-year observations from 1871 to 2012. At each progression step, the prediction equation is derived using only 50-year training data and the AIRI is predicted for the ensuing 10 years (see Methods). These 10-year rolling predictions are ‘independent’ in the sense that no ‘future’ (after initial date of prediction) information is used beyond the training period. Starting from 1871, totally, 10 segments of 10-year predictions were made for the 92 years (1921–2012). The 92-year retrospective forecast correlation skill reaches 0.64 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>), and the truly independent forecast skill for 1989–2012 is 0.51, which is significantly higher than the IMD operational forecast skill (−0.12). The deterministic skill measure here also reflects the probabilistic measure as they are related<sup><a href="#ref16" title="Wang, B. et al. Advance and prospectus of seasonal prediction: assessment of the APCC/CliPAS 14-model ensemble retrospective seasonal prediction (1980-2004). Clim. Dyn. 33, 93-117 (2009)." id="ref-link-36">16</a></sup>. Previous studies<sup><a href="#ref27" title="DelSole, T. &amp; Shukla, J. Climate models produce skillful predictions of Indian summer monsoon rainfall. Geophys. Res. Lett. 39, L09703 (2012)." id="ref-link-37">27</a>, <a href="#ref28" title="DelSole, T. &amp; Shukla, J.

Clim. 22, 331-345 (2009)." id="ref-link-38">28</a></sup> have reported maximum correlation skill of ~0.5 from statistical and dynamical forecast models for shorter periods; thus, the skill here demonstrates a substantial improvement over past predictions.</p>

	<p>As shown by Delsole and Shukla<sup><a href="#ref28" title="DelSole, T. &amp; Shukla, J. Artificial skill due to predictor screening. J. Clim. 22, 331-345 (2009)." id="ref-link-39">28</a></sup>, if all the data (model development and validation) are used to select the predictors, the cross-validated skill may be inflated. For the period of 1921–1950, the forecast used partial training information so that the skill of 0.68 in this period is possibly partially inflated. For the period of 1951–1988, the forecast used full training information so that the prediction skill of 0.74 during this period is likely more inflated. However, the independent forecast skill of 0.51 for the 1989–2012 is independent of training period data, thus not inflated.</p><h2>Causes of the low forecast skills in the recent decades</h2><p>The recent 24 years are indeed a challenging period for ISMR prediction: the P–E model has a high skill of 0.77 for 1960–1988 but drops to 0.51 for 1989–2012 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). This is mainly attributed to the drastic weakening of the AIRI–EPT predictor relationship (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). In <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>, a test of significance of running correlations<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Gershunov, A., Schneider, N. &amp; Barnett, T. Low-frequency modulation of the ENSO-Indian monsoon rainfall relationship: signal or noise? J. Clim. 14, 2486-2492 (2001)." id="ref-link-40">29</a></sup> was carried out. The running correlations between the predictor EPT (CPT) and AIRI are significantly more variable than expected from noise at 95<span class="mb">%</span> (90<span class="mb">%</span>) confidence level. The running correlations with PSH, NAT and the hindcast are insignificantly distinguishable from those expected from noise.</p><p>The AIRI–CPT relationship became significant after 1940 when the ocean observation improves (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>). In the recent three decades, the AIRI–CPT relationship remains significant especially after the late 1990s when CP–ENSO became the dominant mode of ENSO<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Xiang, B., Wang, B. &amp; Li, T. A new paradigm for the predominance of standing Central Pacific warming after the late 1990s. Clim. Dyn. 41, 327-340 (2013)." id="ref-link-41">30</a></sup>. It is notable that the land warming predictor (NAT) is complementary to EPT; its increasing skill in the recent decades tends to compensate the decreasing skill of EPT (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). Although the prediction skill is relatively low in the recent decades, the three new predictors (PSH, CPT and NAT) positively contribute to the improved skill.</p><p>We further analysed the 46-year hindcast data made by the ENSEMBLE models to find why the dynamical MME hindcast skill sharply declined after the late 1970s. The results in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f5">Fig. 5</a> indicate that the ENSEMBLE models’ MME captures the AIRI–EPT and AIRI–PSH relationship reasonably well but overestimate the former compared with the observed weakening relationship. However, the models totally missed the CP–ENSO and Asian Low (NAT) predictors. When the ENSO behaviour (amplitude, frequency, structure and evolution) changed in the late 1970s (refs <a href="#ref23" title="Kumar, K. K., Rajagopalan, B., Hoerling, M., Bates, G. &amp; Cane, M.

Interdecadal change of the structure of the ENSO Mode and its impact on the ENSO frequency[ast]. J.

In addition, the Asian Low predictor has significant contribution to the AIRI in the recent period (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f4">Fig. 4b</a>), but the models have no capacity in catching up this tendency (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150518/ncomms8154/full/ncomms8154.html#f5">Fig. 5d,h</a>).</p>
