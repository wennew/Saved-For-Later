However, the relationship between the two modes remains unclear. A close inspection reveals that the SAM was significantly correlated with the SSDMs during the austral summer before the mid-1980s. However, the correlations have degraded since then. This decadal shift in the relationship between these two southern dominant modes is due to a weakened connection between the SAM and the subtropical highs that control the SSDMs. This decadal change could be traced back to a poleward shift in the southern westerly belt. The El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) typically plays a moderate role in influencing the precipitation in Australia and a minor role in influencing the precipitation in Africa and South America. Nevertheless, the two southern modes could still affect the austral summer rainfall in the mid-latitudes, even though the ENSO signal is absent. All these links between the two southern modes and southern land precipitation may be attributable to the associated transport of moisture in the lower-level circulation.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><p>* </p><i>Corresponding author address:</i><p> Li Yan, State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China.
