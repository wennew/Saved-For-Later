		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Two hydrographic surveys in the Gulf of Alaska and the North Pacific subtropical gyre are presented. Both surveys are roughly perpendicular to lateral temperature gradients, and were collected in the summer when there was a shallow mixed layer and a seasonal thermocline. Isopycnal displacements and horizontal velocities are dominated by internal waves. Spice anomalies along isopycnals are examined to diagnose lateral stirring mechanisms. The spectra of spice anomaly gradients along near-surface isopycnals roughly follow power laws of <img alt="image" src="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2013JC009421/asset/image_n/jgrc21161-gra-0001.png?v=1&amp;s=77d8bf4f23808a6ea4dd2523e7bf080e781b04d4"> (variance spectra power laws of <img alt="image" src="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2013JC009421/asset/image_n/jgrc21161-gra-0002.png?v=1&amp;s=15df210f9450b72c3c197a69fe1b27d2318a53df">), and in most cases the spectra become redder at depth.
