black carbon, BC) aerosols is distinct: the former cools the planet by
reducing solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere and the surface,
without largely affecting the atmospheric column, while the latter heats the

show that the structure of the tropospheric response is remarkably similar
between the two types of aerosols, featuring a deep vertical structure of
temperature change (of opposite sign) at the Northern Hemisphere (NH)
mid-latitudes. The deep temperature structure is anchored by the slow
response of the ocean, as a large meridional sea surface temperature (SST)
gradient drives an anomalous inter-hemispheric Hadley circulation in the
tropics and induces atmospheric eddy adjustments at the NH mid-latitudes. The
tropospheric warming in response to projected future decline in reflecting
aerosols poses additional threats to the stability of mountain glaciers in
the NH. Additionally, robust tropospheric response is unique to aerosol
forcing and absent in the CO<sub>2</sub> response, which can be exploited for
climate change attribution.
