Taken together, we derive a statistically indistinguishable eLGM advance across the entire Patagonian Ice Sheet, centered on 28,420 ± 460 years (see materials and methods for detailed description). This age is statistically different to the global LGM (23,000-19,000 years), and indicates the maximum extent of the Patagonian Ice Sheet was achieved over 5,500 years before the global LGM; this is consistent with estimates of maximum cooling in New Zealand at 28,500–30,500 years ago<sup><a href="#ref4" title="Vandergoes, M.

Previous modeling studies have argued that sea ice plays a critical role in atmospheric circulation change in the Southern Hemisphere, and can significantly alter the location and intensity of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream<sup><a href="#ref7" title="Timmermann, A. et al. Modeling Obliquity and CO2 Effects on Southern Hemisphere Climate during the Past 408 ka.

However, these studies either integrate changes over long time periods, or prescribe the extent of sea ice in an atmospheric general circulation model, thus they may not fully resolve the detail of potential changes in ocean properties that can lead to important feedbacks within the climate system. Therefore, given the apparent sensitivity of sea-ice extent to both CO<sub>2</sub> and obliquity, we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere-land-sea-ice climate model<sup><a href="#ref26" title="Phipps, S.

	<p>Our simulations identify a marked reduction in temperature during 28.5 ka relative to 49 ka over Patagonia during the austral summer in <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f2">Fig. 2a</a>, and winter in <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>. Whilst the region of cooling varies spatially between seasons its focus extends from 40<b>°</b>S to beyond 60<b>°</b>S and is centered on 53<b>°</b>S, covering a broad longitudinal swathe of the region (120 to 30<b>°</b>W). This temperature reduction is accompanied by a marked increase in wind strength, implying a notable shift in Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation between maximum and minimum obliquity. Our simulations suggest that during the austral summer the westerly winds intensify and broaden hemisphere wide, only reducing marginally over New Zealand (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). This is consistent with changes to minimum obliquity, which reduces summer-winter seasonality. The result for the austral summer is a change in the vertical and meridional distribution of the mean flow such that it weakens the seasonal migration of the Hadley Cell in the Southern Hemisphere, leading to a northward shifted subtropical jet during the 28.5 ka period relative to mean circulation at 49 ka. In the austral winter the flow differences between the 28.5 ka and 49 ka simulations show a more zonal pattern (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f3">Fig. 3c</a>).</p><p>At the same time, the orbital parameters and greenhouse gas concentration at 28.5 ka drive an asymmetric equatorward expansion of Antarctic sea ice (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>) that intensifies the southern mid-latitude sea surface temperature (SST) gradient (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f5">Fig. 5a</a>). It has been previously shown that changes in sea-ice extent and mid-latitude SST gradients affect the location of storm tracks and the eddy-driven jet through increases in atmospheric baroclinicity<sup><a href="#ref25" title="Kidston, J., Taschetto, A. S., Thompson, D. W. J. &amp; England., M. H. The influence of Southern Hemisphere sea-ice extent on the latitude of the mid-latitude jet stream. Geophysical Research Letters, 38, L15804 (2011)." id="ref-link-47">25</a>, <a href="#ref27" title="Brayshaw, D. J., Hoskins, B. &amp; Blackburn, M. The storm-track response to idealized SST perturbations in an aqua planet GCM. J. Atmos. Sci., 65, 2842–2860. (2008)." id="ref-link-48">27</a></sup>. During the 28.5 ka period, the strengthened SST gradient in the southern mid-latitudes intensifies the lower troposphere baroclinicity, leading to a southward shift of the eddy-driven jet. This change leads to a broadening of the latitudinal zone of the storm-tracks that in turn intensifies the westerlies, with a marked focus over southern South America (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). It appears, therefore, that the stronger winds and cooler temperatures at 28.5 ka nourished the Patagonian ice sheet more effectively at 28.5 ka than during the subsequent global LGM at 21 ka.</p><p>The increase in the westerly winds is seen year-round, despite variations in structure, with expansion in the austral summer months and strong zonation in winter (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f2">Figs 2</a>c and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f3">3</a>c) During the 28.5 ka austral winter, the Hadley Cell slightly weakens as a consequence of the reduced seasonality in a lower obliquity climate. However, the largest changes in the zonal mean flow distribution occur in the strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere storm track. The expansion of the Antarctic sea ice to the southern margin of the lower tropospheric baroclinic zone acts to increase the mid-latitude temperature gradient, thus intensifying baroclinicity from 60<b>°</b>S to 45<b>°</b>S at 28.5 ka. The resulting strengthened westerlies have a particularly marked effect in the Pacific sector where sea ice reaches its most northward latitude (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). This result differs somewhat in extent from recent simulations using a coupled general circulation model of intermediate complexity which posit maximum temperature changes were more zonal and concentrated at around 55<b>°</b>S<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>The expansion of the Antarctic sea ice during 28.5 ka compared to 49 ka maximum obliquity period directly affects the Southern Ocean, as seen in the reductions predicted in SST Figure (5a). Sea surface salinities increase south of Drake Passage, and decrease to the north of this region (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f5">Fig. 5c</a>). This pattern of salinity forcing increases the density gradient across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), significantly enhancing ACC transport through the thermal wind balance. The meridional expansion of sea-ice at 28.5 ka increases the SST gradient at mid-latitudes, particularly during austral summer when sea ice experiences larger changes compared to the 49 ka model runs.</p><p>Our simulations suggest that low obliquity triggered marked intensification of atmospheric circulation in the SH, resulting in a significant increase in the Southern Ocean barotropic streamfunction between 49 ka and 28.5 ka (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f5">Fig. 5e</a>). Although this trend continued into the global LGM (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f5">Fig. 5f</a>) –agreeing with previous LGM modeling studies<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Otto-Bliesner, B. et al. Last glacial maximum and Holocene climate in CCSM3. J. Clim. 19, 2526–2544 (2006)." id="ref-link-49">28</a></sup>– the regional year-round cooling over Patagonia at 28.5 ka led to cool winters and critically cool summers, with only a slight change in precipitation, encouraging positive ice-sheet mass balance during the obliquity minimum. These conditions could have driven marked ice-sheet expansion across Patagonia at 28.5 ka through positive mass balance with low rates of summer ablation.</p><p>The mechanisms behind the pronounced atmospheric cooling driven by expansion of Antarctic sea ice and orbital parameters can be explored through an independent suite of numerical experiments performed with the atmospheric component of the NCAR CCSM3 model (See methods)<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Collins, W. D. &amp; Rasch, P. J. e. a. Description of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3.0), Technical Report NCAR/TN-464 + STR. National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado, 210 (2004)." id="ref-link-50">29</a></sup>. The model simulated the meridional shift of the Hadley cell to the 28.5 ka orbital conditions and the intensification of the Southern Hemisphere storm track caused by the northward expansion of Antarctic sea-ice, supporting the CSIRO Mk3L model simulations. Whilst in this case the use of an atmospheric model limits the realistic representation of past climate periods due to the lack of an ocean feedback, it supports our interpretation of the atmospheric response to orbital forcing, related to a prescribed change in sea-ice extent (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#supplementary-information">Figure S1</a>).</p><p>Our simulations demonstrate that while cooling was focused over Patagonia, the atmospheric conditions exhibit an influence across a broad swathe of the mid- to high-latitudes of the SH in our fully coupled model simulations. The relationship with sea ice, air temperature and precipitation is key to understanding the ice-sheet response. Our results suggest that the regional year-round cooling over Patagonia led to cool winters and cool summers, with only slight changes in precipitation, encouraging positive ice-sheet mass balance during the obliquity minimum. These conditions would have driven marked ice-sheet expansion across Patagonia at 28.5 ka through positive mass balance with low rates of summer ice ablation despite relatively high CO<sub>2</sub> when compared to 21 ka (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f1">Fig. 1d</a>). Although the relationship with precipitation is spatially variable between the simulations, a comparison between the 50-year mean values shows a stepwise downward trajectory in precipitation between our simulations across the region (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f4">Fig. 4e</a>). We suggest this downward trend reflects the combination of predicted temperature and precipitation decreases and the increase in sea-ice extent between 28.5 ka and 21 ka (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f4">Fig. 4b,d,e</a>). At 21 ka our model results implys sea-ice extent is greater year-round having the net effect of reducing regional temperatures and effective precipitation in the region during both the austral summer and the austral winter (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11673/full/srep11673.html#f4">Fig. 4e</a>).

These differences are addressed in turn.</p><p>Firstly, cosmogenic isotope analysis from glacial moraines from Lake Pukkaki, New Zealand appear to show significant expansion of ice at around 42 ka BP, which is more extensive than that recorded between 28-25 ka suggesting an early advance within this glacial catchment during a period of high obliquity<sup><a href="#ref13" title="Kelley, S.

Although this is a well dated example of potentially high obliquity driven glacier advance, it is not apparent in any other regional palaeoenvironmental records<sup><a href="#ref4" title="Vandergoes, M. J. et al. Regional insolation forcing of late Quaternary climate change in the Southern Hemisphere.

Additionally emerging data suggests there were multiple expansions of ice at some sites in New Zealand and potentially in Chile during Oxygen Isotope Stage 3<sup><a href="#ref31" title="Putnam, A.

Although we find no evidence of them at the sites highlighted in this study, we cannot discount the possibility of earlier glacial expansions that were subsequently overrun by the eLGM expansion we report here. Clearly more detailed direct chronologies are required to fully resolve this question. Secondly, it is apparent that sea ice proxy reconstructions from marine cores in the South Atlantic and Scotia Sea provide very different interpretations across the mid- to high-latitude Southern Ocean during the last 50,000 yrs<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Collins, L. G. et al. High-resolution reconstruction of southwest Atlantic sea-ice and its role in the carbon cycle during marine isotope stages 3 and 2.

These differences may well reflect in part the challenges of reconstructing sea ice cover from proxy evidence with limited age control.
