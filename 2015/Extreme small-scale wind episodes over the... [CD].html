With the increasing marine activity in the region, it is important to study the climatology and variability of episodes with strong winds, as well as to understand their causes. Explosive marine cyclogenesis is usually caused by a combination of several mechanisms: upper-level forcing, stratospheric dry intrusions, latent heat release, surface energy fluxes, low-level baroclinicity. An additional factor that has been linked to extremely strong surface winds, is low static stability in the lower atmosphere, which allows for downward transfer of high-momentum air. Here the most extreme small-scale wind episodes in a high-resolution (5 km) 35-year hindcast were analyzed, and it was found that they were associated with unusually strong low-level baroclinicity and surface heat fluxes.
