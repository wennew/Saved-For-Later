		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Using autonomous underwater gliders, we quantified diurnal periodicity in dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and temperature in the subtropical North Pacific near the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) Station ALOHA during summer 2012. Oxygen optodes provided sufficient stability and precision to quantify diel cycles of average amplitude of 0.6 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup>. A theoretical diel curve was fit to daily observations to infer an average mixed layer gross primary productivity (GPP) of 1.8 mmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−3</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>. Cumulative net community production (NCP) over 110 days was 500 mmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> for the mixed layer, which averaged 57 m in depth. Both GPP and NCP estimates indicated a significant period of below-average productivity at Station ALOHA in 2012, an observation confirmed by <sup>14</sup>C productivity incubations and O<sub>2</sub>/Ar ratios. Given our success in an oligotrophic gyre where biological signals are small, our diel GPP approach holds promise for remote characterization of productivity across the spectrum of marine environments.</p></div>
