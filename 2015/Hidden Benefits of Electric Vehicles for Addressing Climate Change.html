	<p>First, we analysed the decreased heat emissions caused by the replacement of CVs with EVs. Second, based on the statistics of the contribution of air conditioners in buildings to UHIE and the assumed linear relationship between heat emissions and HII, we deduced the impact of anthropogenic heat emissions on HII. Finally, according to the impact of HII changes on air-conditioning consumption in buildings, we achieved the decreased air-conditioning energy consumption by the replacement.</p><h2>Heat emissions ratio of EVs to CVs</h2><p>Energy consumed by CVs is all converted to heat and eventually emitted to the air. Engines of CVs convert fuel energy into thermal and mechanical energy. Then the mechanical energy is converted to heat by overcoming mechanical friction, wind and tire rolling resistance. Energy consumed by EVs is also converted to heat eventually.</p><p>In Beijing, the average fuel economy of light-duty vehicles was estimated to be 20.6 miles per gallon in 2012<sup><a href="#ref12" title="Yang, J., Liu, Y., Qin, P. &amp; Liu, A.

</p><h2>HII mitigation</h2><p>The average HII was 2.77°C during the summer of 2005 in Beijing<sup><a href="#ref28" title="Liao, M. The HII would be reduced more than ten percent in 15 years in Beijing. News (2005) Available at: http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-08/23/content_3392449.htm (Accessed: 23th August 2005) (in Chinese)." id="ref-link-29">28</a></sup> and 2.90°C in 2009<sup><a href="#ref29" title="Di, S., Wu, W., Liu, H., Yang, S. &amp; Pan, X.

According to the growth rate of HII from 2005 to 2009, we estimated HII to be 3.0°C in 2012. Heat emissions, mainly caused by vehicles and air conditioners in buildings, contributed to about half of the HII in Beijing<sup><a href="#ref16" title="Li, Y. &amp; Zhao, X.

</p><p>where ΔHII is the decreased HII resulting from the decreased heat emissions with the replacement and <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> is the contribution of heat emissions to HII in Beijing.</p><h2>Reduction of air-conditioning energy consumption</h2><p>If HII were to decrease by 1°C, the energy consumed by air conditioners in buildings would decrease by 12.8% during the summer in Beijing<sup><a href="#ref11" title="Li, C. et al. Interaction between urban microclimate and electric air-conditioning energy consumption during high temperature season. Applied Energy 117, 149–156 (2014)." id="ref-link-32">11</a></sup>. Although the estimation in Ref. <a href="#ref16" title="Li, Y. &amp; Zhao, X. An empirical study of the impact of human activity on long-term temperature change in China: A perspective from energy consumption. Journal of Geophysical Research 17, 1–12 (2012)." id="ref-link-33">16</a> is based on data from Beijing in 2005, air-conditioning energy consumption has taken an increasing proportion of total energy consumption in recent years<sup><a href="#ref23" title="Hou, C., Wang, H. &amp; Ouyang, M.

The reduction of HII resulting from the replacement is near 1°C. We assume the reduction of HII and air-conditioning energy saving is a linear relationship.

</p><p>where Δ<i>P</i><sub>5</sub> is the decreased energy consumed by air conditioners in buildings with CVs replaced, and <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> is the ratio of Δ<i>P</i><sub>5</sub> to energy consumed by EVs. With the decrease in air-conditioning energy consumption, less heat would be emitted, which would also contribute to mitigating UHIE and energy saving.</p><h2>Reduction of CO<sub>2</sub></h2><p>In 2012 in China, 740 g of CO<sub>2</sub> was emitted when 1 kWh of electricity was supplied to consumers<sup><a href="#ref30" title="Birol, F. et al.

Therefore, when 14.44 million kWh are saved, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions could be reduced 10,686 tonnes.</p><p>The data in this paper are mainly from the government of Beijing and the State Grid Beijing Electric Power Company. In this paper, we have to use some data of other years because some data of 2012 are not available. Therefore, our estimation of the benefits of replacing CVs with EVs is slightly lower than its actual contribution.</p><p>According to the analysis and estimation above, the replacement of CVs by EVs can substantially alleviate UHIE in the summer in metropolitan areas, which can improve the local climate, significantly reduce air-conditioning energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, thus helping to address global climate change.</p>
