		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Previous studies focusing on the remote detection of Mediterranean Eddies (Meddies) have reported that the isopycnal surface changes derived from satellite multi-sensor measurements at the approximate depth of 400m can be used to sense the presence of underlying Meddies. While the isopycnal surface near that depth does indeed reveal the locations of Meddies, an analysis of isopycnal surface changes in response to the evolution of Meddies has yet to be made. Accordingly, this research focuses on analyzing the relationship between isopycnal surface changes and the evolution of Meddies. The vertical isopycnal surface variability of Meddies, which is directly related to contributions from rotational velocity, interior thermal variation, and vertical displacement of Meddies, is observed and studied using float observations from A Mediterranean Undercurrent Seeding Experiment (AMUSE). The contributions of each of the three aforementioned parameters are estimated, enabling us to understand their relative role in changing the isopycnal surface above Meddies. Furthermore, in order to further understand Meddies' evolution and their associated forcing, the dominant frequencies of their horizontal and vertical displacements, as well as the sea surface height variability above the Meddy, are analyzed using the Hilbert – Huang Transform. Finally, the horizontal and the vertical eddy viscosity dissipation of Meddies is computed and compared with a theoretical model. The empirical horizontal and the vertical eddy viscosities are found to be 7x10<sup>6</sup>cm<sup>2</sup>sec<sup>−1</sup> and 200cm<sup>2</sup>sec<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. This study will therefore contribute to understanding how the isopycnal surface is related to the presence of Meddies, what frequencies are dominate its variability, and the values of eddy viscosity which can be used for a numerical model.
