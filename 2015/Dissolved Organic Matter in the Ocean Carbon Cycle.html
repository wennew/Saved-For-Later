<p>The demand to understand DOC has escalated with time, creating new challenges and opportunities [<em>Hansell and Carlson</em>, 2015].</p>
<p><aside class="pull-quote u-float-right">A major challenge is to determine the role the DOC reservoir plays in regulating Earth’s climate.</aside>A major challenge is to determine the role the DOC reservoir plays in regulating Earth’s climate [<em>Ridgwell and Arndt</em>, 2015]. As much as 500 times more organic carbon may have been dissolved in the ocean during the Neoproterozoic Era (1000–543 million years ago; see <em>Rothman et al.</em> [2003]), and more than twice as much as at present may have been held in the deep ocean during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs (~65–34 million years ago), perhaps serving as the carbon reservoir being released to the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub> to drive the brief but regular warm events of that era [<em>Sexton et al.</em>, 2011].</p>
<p>Comparing those climates to ours today may elucidate the potential of our oceans to serve as a natural capacitor for carbon storage and release over geologic periods, giving up its carbon to the atmosphere as CO<sub>2 </sub>to drive warm periods and pulling it back to force cool phases.</p>
<p>The research community is determining how DOC sources and sinks—both biotic and abiotic—operate today; this knowledge is required to understand mechanistically DOC’s role in past and future oceans. Vast opportunities for discovery await.</p>
