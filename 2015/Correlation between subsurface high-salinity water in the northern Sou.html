		<b>Correlation between subsurface high-salinity water in the northern South China Sea and the North Equatorial Current–Kuroshio circulation system from HYCOM simulations</b><br><br>Ocean Science, 11, 305-312, 2015<br><br>Author(s): A. Wang, Y. Du, W. Zhuang, and Y. Qi<br><br>The North Pacific Tropical Water (NPTW), characterized by subsurface high
salinity, is observed in the South China Sea (SCS) and is often used as an
indicator of the water intrusion from the northwestern Pacific into the SCS.
Based on the assimilation product from a global high-resolution Hybrid
Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) from 2008 through 2013, this study
investigates the seasonal variability of subsurface high-salinity water
(SHSW) in the northern SCS and its relationship with the North Equatorial
Current–Kuroshio circulation system. Results show that the obvious seasonal
variability of the SHSW appears at about 100–200 m in depth. It extends as
far west as southeast of Hainan, reaching its volume maximum (minimum) in
January (May). The seasonal variance contribution (seasonal variance
accounting for the entire variance) is 0.38 in the period we considered,
albeit with significant annual variance in other years. Further analysis
shows that the changes in high-salinity water volume are highly correlated
with the shift in the North Equatorial Current bifurcation latitude (NECBL),
which reaches its northernmost point in December and its southernmost point
in May. Due to the large-scale wind changes in the Pacific, the Luzon Strait
transport (LST) weakens (strengthens) when the NECBL shifts to the south
(north) during summer (winter), which results in the reduced (enhanced) SHSW
intrusion from the northwestern Pacific into the northern SCS. It is also
found that, on a seasonal timescale, the Kuroshio transport (KT) does not
vary in phase with NECBL, LST and SHSW, indicating that the KT changes are
probably not the governing factor for the seasonal variability of SHSW in the
northern SCS.
