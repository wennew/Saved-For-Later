To interpret FACE results in the context of gradual increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> over decades to centuries, we used a suite of seven models to simulate the Duke and Oak Ridge FACE experiments extended for 300 years of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment.

All models simulated increased terrestrial C pools resulting from CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, though there was substantial variability in quasi-equilibrium C sequestration and rates of change. In two of two models that assume that plant nitrogen (N) uptake is solely a function of soil N supply, the net primary production response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> became progressively N limited. In four of five models that assume that N uptake is a function of both soil N supply and plant N demand, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> led to reduced ecosystem N losses and thus progressively relaxed nitrogen limitation.
