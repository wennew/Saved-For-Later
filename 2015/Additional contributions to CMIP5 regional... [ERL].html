		The impact of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass loss on regional sea level is evaluated hereunder RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the period 2081?2099. To this end, estimates of associatedfresh water sources are added to the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology?s Earth System Model oceancomponent and the dynamical impact is quantified in terms of the difference in sea level relative toprevious phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project runs. Overall, the addition of thesefreshwater sources have only a small impact on regional sea level variations relative to the globalmean (&lt;2 cm in magnitude). However, in some regions, notably in the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean,an additional increase in regional steric sea level by 4?8 cm can be obtained, which is ?20% morethan the previous climate model response.
