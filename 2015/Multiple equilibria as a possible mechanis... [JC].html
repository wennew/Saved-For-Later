However, the applicability of these results in the real world is challenging due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we show that recent attempts to reconstruct the decadal variations in one of the dominant circulation systems of the region, the subpolar gyre (SPG) are not always consistent. A coherent picture is partly recovered by a simple conceptual model solely forced by reanalyzed surface air temperatures. This confirms that surface heat flux indeed plays a leading role for this type of variability as has been suggested in previous studies. The results further suggest that large variations in the SPG correspond to the crossing of a bifurcation point that is predicted from idealized experiments and an analytical solution of our model. Performance of our conceptual model is tested against a statistical stochastic model. Hysteresis and the existence of two stable modes of the SPG circulation shape its response to forcing by atmospheric temperatures. The identification of the essential dynamics and the reduction to a minimal model of SPG variability provide a quantifiable basis and a framework for future studies on decadal climate variability and predictability.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><p>* </p><i>Corresponding author address:</i><p> Physics Institute, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.
