		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>An idealized dataset that contains a background seasonal mean state, a reference intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) state and real-strength tropical cyclones (TCs) was constructed, in order to examine to what extent the presence of the real-strength TCs may impact the overall ISO strength over the western North Pacific. The averaged ISO strength (measured by combined 850-hPa zonal and meridional wind fields) increases by 9% when the realistic TCs are included. The percentage increase of the overall ISO strength depends on the variable used. It is doubled (reduced to 3%) when the vorticity (stream function) is used as the estimated variable.</p></div>
