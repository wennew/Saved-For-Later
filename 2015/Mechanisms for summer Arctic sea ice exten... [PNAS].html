                              and a delay in attaining a summer ice-free Arctic. This plausible scenario with broad ecological and economic impacts should
                              not be ignored.

                           <h2>Abstract</h2>
                           <p id="p-4">Satellite observations reveal a substantial decline in September Arctic sea ice extent since 1979, which has played a leading
                              role in the observed recent Arctic surface warming and has often been attributed, in large part, to the increase in greenhouse
                              gases. However, the most rapid decline occurred during the recent global warming hiatus period. Previous studies are often
                              focused on a single mechanism for changes and variations of summer Arctic sea ice extent, and many are based on short observational
                              records. The key players for summer Arctic sea ice extent variability at multidecadal/centennial time scales and their contributions
                              to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline are not well understood. Here a multiple regression model is developed for the
                              first time, to the author’s knowledge, to provide a framework to quantify the contributions of three key predictors (Atlantic/Pacific
                              heat transport into the Arctic, and Arctic Dipole) to the internal low-frequency variability of Summer Arctic sea ice extent,
                              using a 3,600-y-long control climate model simulation. The results suggest that changes in these key predictors could have
                              contributed substantially to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline. If the ocean heat transport into the Arctic were
                              to weaken in the near future due to internal variability, there might be a hiatus in the decline of September Arctic sea ice.
                              The modeling results also suggest that at multidecadal/centennial time scales, variations in the atmosphere heat transport
                              across the Arctic Circle are forced by anticorrelated variations in the Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic.
