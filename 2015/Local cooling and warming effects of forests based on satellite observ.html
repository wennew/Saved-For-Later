					<h2>Data and analysis</h2><p>MODIS 8-day Aqua LST data (from MYD11C2) are retrieved in clear-sky conditions<sup><a href="#ref40" title="Wan, Z. New refinements and validation of the MODIS land-surface temperature/emissivity products. Remote Sens. Environ. 112, 59–74 (2008) ." id="ref-link-77">40</a></sup> and have overpass time at 1:30 and 13:30 hours, which are close to the times of daily minimum and maximum temperature. We extract LST with estimated emissivity error &lt;=0.02 and LST error &lt;=1 K. It should be noted that the Aqua LST data start from July 2002, while other MODIS data incorporate information from the Terra satellite and start from January 2002.</p><p>The 16-day MODIS shortwave albedo product (MCD43C3) comprises black-sky and white-sky albedo. Calculation of the actual (blue-sky) albedo, which is a combination of black-sky and white-sky albedo, requires the ratio of the direct to diffusive shortwave radiation. We simply assume the blue-sky albedo to be the average of black-sky and white-sky albedo because their difference is very small and they are highly correlated (<i>R</i>=0.9992). Moreover, there is no consensus on the choice of albedo in the literature (for example, Luyssaert <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref43" title="Luyssaert, S. Land management and land-cover change have impacts of similar magnitude on surface temperature. Nat. Clim. Change 4, 389–393 (2014) ." id="ref-link-78">43</a></sup> and Peng <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref25" title="Peng, S.-S. et al. Afforestation in China cools local land surface temperature. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 111, 2915–2919 (2014) ." id="ref-link-79">25</a></sup> used black and white albedos, respectively). In fact, the choice of specific albedo (white, black, or blue sky) would have little impact on our analysis. Regarding data quality, only data with a QC flag of 0 (best quality), 1 (good quality), or 2 (mixed quality) are used. Snow information is included as a part of the albedo data set. We calculate snow frequency as the percentage of days in a year where the land surface is covered by snow, reflecting the duration of snow cover.</p><p>In addition, we use another MODIS based 8-day albedo product, GLASS<sup><a href="#ref46" title="Liu, Q., Wang, L., Qu, Y., Liu, N. &amp; Liu, S. Preliminary evaluation of the long-term GLASS albedo product. Int. J. Digit. Earth 6, 69–95 (2013) ." id="ref-link-80">46</a>, <a href="#ref47" title="Liu, N. F. et al. A statistics-based temporal filter algorithm to map spatiotemporally continuous shortwave albedo from MODIS data. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. 17, 2121–2129 (2013) ." id="ref-link-81">47</a></sup>, from 2002 to 2012. The selected QC flags are ‘00’ and ‘01’, indicating uncertainty of &lt;5 and 10%, respectively. The GLASS albedo data are used to verify the latitudinal pattern of Δalbedo in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>.</p><p>Monthly ET is estimated by an algorithm<sup><a href="#ref48" title="Mu, Q. Z., Zhao, M. S. &amp; Running, S. W. Improvements to a MODIS global terrestrial evapotranspiration algorithm. Remote Sens. Environ. 115, 1781–1800 (2011) ." id="ref-link-82">48</a></sup> that calculates daytime and nighttime ET and other variables including latent heat and shortwave radiation.</p><p>Land cover data from MCD12C1 with IGBP classification in 2012 are used to define forest and open land. Five forest types (evergreen needleleaf, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf, and mixed forests) are combined into a single ‘forest’ category. ‘Open land’ refers to grassland and cropland. Only forest and open land (grass/crop) pixels with over 80% covered area are taken into account for our analysis.</p><p>Precipitation data are from Climatic Research Unit time-series data sets (CRU TS3.21) at 0.5° resolution. An additional air temperature data set—the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly, which is used in the analysis of LST versus air temperature—can be obtained from <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcnm/v3.php">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcnm/v3.php</a>. We use the homogeneity adjusted temperature records for our analysis. CRU precipitation data and Global Historical Climatology Network temperature data are from January 2002 to December 2012.</p><p>Digital elevation model is the 1-km Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 30 (SRTM30) version 2.1, which is resampled into 0.05° to match MODIS data.</p><p>All MODIS variables in the analysis, except land cover, are based on multi-year averages between 2002 and 2013, which are first calculated at the MODIS data composite time scale of each variable (for example, 8 days for LST or 16 days for albedo) and then aggregated to monthly, seasonal, and annual means. MODIS data, including LST, albedo, ET, and land cover, have the spatial resolution at Climate Modeling Grid (0.05°). Extracting high-quality satellite data only (selected by MODIS QC) inevitably results in some data gaps. For example, there are less valid albedo data in tropical and high-latitude regions primarily due to the unfavourable atmospheric conditions like cloud contamination<sup><a href="#ref49" title="Gao, F. et al. MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function and albedo Climate Modeling Grid products and the variability of albedo for major global vegetation types. J. Geophys. Res. 110, D01104 (2005) ." id="ref-link-83">49</a></sup> and high solar zenith angles<sup><a href="#ref50" title="Stroeve, J. et al. Accuracy assessment of the MODIS 16- day albedo product for snow: comparisons with Greenland in situ measurements. Remote Sens. Environ. 94, 46–60 (2005) ." id="ref-link-84">50</a></sup>. Our analysis is based on the climatology values in the period 2002–2013 to increase the number of available high-quality data and to minimize the influence of interannual climate variability.</p><h2>Window searching strategy</h2><p>We apply a window searching strategy to find all available samples to compare forest with open land across the globe (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>). This strategy ensures that all forests and open lands that are close in distance and share similar climate background are compared. Forests near grass/crop lands are also considered to be most susceptible to future land cover change. The search window size is 9 × 5 pixels (longitude × latitude), approximately equal to 50 km × 28 km. Two adjacent windows are partially overlapping along both the longitudinal (4 pixels) and latitudinal (2 pixels) directions. If both forest and open land pixels exist within a window, it would be a valid comparison sample and subsequently we calculate the mean differences in LST, ET, albedo, elevation, and so on, of forest minus open land. Snow frequency of each sample is the average of all forest and open land pixels within a window, and precipitation is taken from the coarser overlapping CRU precipitation grid.</p><h2>Elevation adjustment</h2><p>Because forest and open land pixels may have different elevations even within one window, a systematic bias appears in ΔLST due to lapse rate. To correct this bias, we perform an elevation adjustment by subtracting the elevation-induced ΔLST from the original value (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>). This correction term is the product of the elevation difference (ΔELV) and the regression slope (<i>b</i>) derived from linear regression of ΔLST versus ΔELV. Hence,</p><p>

</p><p>where ΔLST<sub>a</sub> is the adjusted LST difference. To avoid artificial signals resulting from the adjustment, especially when the elevation difference is very large, we constrain our analysis to samples whose elevation differences are within ±500 m. After elevation adjustment, we obtain 11,530 valid comparison samples in the analysis.</p><h2>LST versus air temperature</h2><p>Air temperature is recognized to be generally dependent on LST<sup><a href="#ref51" title="Gallo, K., Hale, R., Tarpley, D. &amp; Yu, Y. Evaluation of the relationship between air and land surface temperature under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions. J. Appl. Meteorol. Climatol. 50, 767–775 (2011) ." id="ref-link-85">51</a></sup>. They are closely coupled, but coupling strength varies across different land covers <sup><a href="#ref52" title="Mildrexler, D. J., Zhao, M. S. &amp; Running, S. W. A global comparison between station air temperatures and MODIS land surface temperatures reveals the cooling role of forests. J. Geophys. Res. 116, G03025 (2011) ." id="ref-link-86">52</a></sup> and weather conditions (cloudy sky or clear sky)<sup><a href="#ref51" title="Gallo, K., Hale, R., Tarpley, D. &amp; Yu, Y. Evaluation of the relationship between air and land surface temperature under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions. J. Appl. Meteorol. Climatol. 50, 767–775 (2011) ." id="ref-link-87">51</a></sup>. In addition, LST and near-surface air temperature have different physical meanings and influencing factors<sup><a href="#ref39" title="Jin, M. &amp; Dickinson, R. E. Land surface skin temperature climatology: benefitting from the strengths of satellite observations. Environ. Res. Lett. 5, 044004 (2010) ." id="ref-link-88">39</a></sup>, thus temperature effects based on LST could be different from the effects based on air temperature. Taking these differences into consideration can avoid a possible misinterpretation that could arise from the use of different temperature metrics<sup><a href="#ref14" title="Zhao, K. &amp; Jackson, R. Biophysical forcings of land-use changes from potential forestry activities in North America. Ecol. Monogr. 84, 329–353 (2014) ." id="ref-link-89">14</a></sup>.</p><p>To better understand this issue, we attempted to estimate the possible influence of quantifying temperature effects using LST versus air temperature.</p><p>We compared MODIS LST and air temperature at all available weather stations of the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly during the study period that are classified as either forest or open land (312 for forest and 944 for open land) by MODIS land cover data. Coupling between LST and air temperature is stronger in forest than in open land, as indicated by the higher correlation coefficient in forest (<i>r</i>=0.87 and 0.83 for maximum and minimum temperature, respectively) than in open land (<i>r</i>=0.83 and 0.76 for maximum and minimum temperature, respectively). We define a term <i>δ</i> as the difference between LST and air temperature:</p><p>

</p><p>where <i>T</i><sub>air</sub>, LST, and <i>δ</i> represent air temperature, LST, and their difference, respectively, and superscripts f and o denote forest and open land.</p><p><a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5</a> shows the LST-air difference term <i>δ</i> in maximum temperature and minimum temperature as a function of latitude (averaged to 1° latitude band). Positive <i>δ</i> means LST is higher than air temperature and vice versa. The difference term <i>δ</i> is positive in maximum temperature for open land at low and mid latitude but negative at high latitude (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5a</a>). For forests, it is negative at almost all latitudes (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5c</a>). As for minimum temperature, a negative <i>δ</i> is found in both open land (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5b</a>) and forests (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5d</a>) at nearly all latitudes. This confirms that there is a systematic difference between LST and air temperature across latitudes as indicated by a previous study<sup><a href="#ref52" title="Mildrexler, D. J., Zhao, M. S. &amp; Running, S. W. A global comparison between station air temperatures and MODIS land surface temperatures reveals the cooling role of forests. J. Geophys. Res. 116, G03025 (2011) ." id="ref-link-90">52</a></sup>.</p><p>Using latitude LST-air difference term <i>δ</i> (equations (3) and (4), and panels (e) and (f) in <a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5</a>), we can infer possible influence of temperature metrics on the ΔLST latitudinal pattern by assuming such a difference applies to all forests and open lands within a given latitude range (equation (5)).</p><p>

</p><p>The overall effect of the correction term (<i>δ</i><sup>o</sup>−<i>δ</i><sup>f</sup>) is to dampen the magnitude of the original ΔLST (LST<sup>f</sup>−LST<sup>o</sup>) pattern for both maximum and minimum temperature (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 5e</a>,f). Another study<sup><a href="#ref43" title="Luyssaert, S. Land management and land-cover change have impacts of similar magnitude on surface temperature. Nat. Clim. Change 4, 389–393 (2014) ." id="ref-link-91">43</a></sup> has shown that land use change has a smaller effect on air temperature than on LST. For instance, the daytime warming in boreal forests and cooling in tropical forests that come from LST would be reduced in air temperature and there would be less night warming in mid latitudes. Similarly, it can be inferred that the daily air temperature difference between forest and open land should be smaller than the daily ΔLST. This is because LST is more sensitive to land surface characteristics and surface energy budget<sup><a href="#ref53" title="Jin, M. S. Developing an index to measure urban heat island effect using satellite land skin temperature and land cover observations. J. Climate 25, 6193–6201 (2012) ." id="ref-link-92">53</a></sup> and has larger diurnal variations than air temperature. However, such qualitative analysis is unable to give an accurate estimate for air temperature because the bias and correction term are estimated at the locations of the Global Historical Climatology Network stations rather than the actual locations of each comparison sample. So the correction term cannot be directly applied to the ΔLST pattern to get the ‘inferred’ or ‘pseudo’ air temperature difference.</p><p>Another source that may contribute to the difference term, <i>δ,</i> is using only clear-sky LST data to calculate ΔLST; limited <i>in situ</i> surface temperature measurements do not allow us to perform a similar analysis as shown above. Nevertheless, some insights can be gained from the existing literature. A study that compared <i>in situ</i> LST and air temperature found that the difference between LST and air temperature is much smaller under cloudy sky than under clear sky<sup><a href="#ref51" title="Gallo, K., Hale, R., Tarpley, D. &amp; Yu, Y. Evaluation of the relationship between air and land surface temperature under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions. J. Appl. Meteorol. Climatol. 50, 767–775 (2011) ." id="ref-link-93">51</a></sup>. This means that cloudy-sky LST is similar to air temperature. With analogy between LST and air temperature, as they are very close under cloudy sky, we tentatively infer that ΔLST under cloudy sky should be smaller than ΔLST observed under clear sky. Therefore, it is expected that ΔLST under all sky conditions should be smaller than the results presented in this paper, which is for clear-sky only. However, this inference has not been independently verified with data and thus should be treated with caution.</p><h2>Sensitivity test</h2><p>We perform sensitivity tests for the definition threshold of forest and open land (70, 60 and 50% areal coverage), size of search window (9 × 1, 5 × 3 and 5 × 1), and elevation adjustment (±100 m, no adjustment). Our results are robust against these choices of parameters.</p><p>Different thresholds of 70, 60 and 50% for defining forest and open land based on their areal percentages are tested (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>). The latitude patterns are consistent through different thresholds. A higher threshold generates a slightly larger ΔLST because a denser forest has a more evident impact. The magnitude of local cooling of a forest also depends on its coverage proportion<sup><a href="#ref32" title="Wickham, J. D., Wade, T. G. &amp; Riitters, K. H. Empirical analysis of the influence of forest extent on annual and seasonal surface temperatures for the continental United States. Glob. Ecol. Biogeogr. 22, 620–629 (2013) ." id="ref-link-94">32</a></sup>.</p><p>Different search windows at sizes of 9 × 1, 5 × 3 and 5 × 1 are tested (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 7</a>). A smaller search window yields fewer comparison samples and thus higher uncertainty at some latitudes. The identified pattern is not significantly affected by the choice of the window size.</p><p>We compare the results with more stringent elevation control (±100 m) as well as no elevation adjustment but the elevation difference is set to be within ±500 m (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150325/ncomms7603/full/ncomms7603.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 8</a>). The more stringent elevation control yields fewer comparison samples and larger confidence interval , but the identified LST pattern is essentially the same. Without elevation adjustment, we see a similar pattern with slight differences at some latitudes where elevation difference is larger. Elevation adjustment has less influence on the results when the elevation control is more stringent. Therefore, our results are unlikely to be an artificial effect due to elevation adjustment.</p>
