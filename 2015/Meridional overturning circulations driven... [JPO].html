Steady-state analytical gyre-scale solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations are derived for a downwelling limb driven in the NH solely by surface heat loss. In these solutions the rates of the water mass transformations between layers driven by the surface heat loss determine the strength of the downwelling limb. Simple expressions are obtained for these transformation rates which depend on the most southerly latitudes where heat loss occurs and the depths of the isopycnals on the eastern boundary. Previously derived expressions for the water mass transformation rates in sub-polar gyres driven by the Ekman upwelling characteristic of the SH are also summarised. Explicit expressions for the MOC transport and the depths of isopycnals on the eastern boundary are then derived by equating the water mass transformations in the upwelling and downwelling limbs. The MOC obtained for a “single-basin” 2-layer model is shown to be generally consistent with that obtained by Gnanadesikan (1999). The model’s energetics are derived and discussed. In a world ocean without a circumpolar channel in the SH it is suggested that the upwelling limb would feed downwelling limbs in both hemispheres. In a world with two basins in the northern hemisphere, if one of them has a strong halocline the model suggests that the MOC would be very weak in that basin.</p></div><p class="artAuthors"/><div class="NLM_author-notes"><a name=""/><div class="NLM_corresp"><a name="cor1"/><p>* </p><i>Corresponding author address:</i><p> Dr Mike Bell, Met Office, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter, EX1 3PB, United Kingdom.
