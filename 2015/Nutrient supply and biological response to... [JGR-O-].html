		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>A fixed-point observation station was set up in the northern Chukchi Sea during autumn 2013, and for about 2 weeks conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD)/water samplings (6-hourly) and microstructure turbulence measurements (two to three times a day) were performed. This enabled us to estimate vertical nutrient fluxes and the impact of different types of turbulent mixing on biological activity. There have been no such fixed-point observations in this region, where incoming low-salinity water from the Pacific Ocean, river water, and sea-ice meltwater promote a strong pycnocline (halocline) that stabilizes the water column. Previous studies have suggested that because of the strong pycnocline wind-induced ocean mixing could not change the stratification to impact biological activity. However, the present study indicates that a combined effect of an uplifted pycnocline accompanied by wind-induced inertial motion and turbulent mixing caused by intense gale-force winds (>10 m s<sup>-1</sup>) did result in increases in upward nutrient fluxes, primary productivity, and phytoplankton biomass, particularly large phytoplankton such as diatoms. Convective mixing associated with internal waves around the pycnocline also increased the upward nutrient fluxes and might have an impact on biological activity there. For diatom production at the fixed-point observation station, it was essential that silicate was supplied from a subsurface silicate maximum, a new feature that we identified during autumn in the northern Chukchi Sea. Water mass distributions obtained from wide-area observations suggest that the subsurface silicate maximum water was possibly derived from the ventilated halocline in the Canada Basin.
