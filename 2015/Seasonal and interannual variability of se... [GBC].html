		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>CO<sub>2</sub> fugacities obtained from a merchant ship sailing from France to French Guyana were used to explore the seasonal and interannual variability of the sea-air CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the western tropical North Atlantic (TNA; 5-14°N, 41-52°W). Two distinct oceanic water masses were identified in the area associated to the main surface currents, i.e. the North Brazil Current (NBC) and the North Equatorial Current (NEC). The NBC was characterized by permanent CO<sub>2</sub> oversaturation throughout the studied period, contrasting with the seasonal pattern identified in the NEC. The NBC retroflection was the main contributor to the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC), thus spreading into the central TNA the Amazon River plume and the CO<sub>2</sub>–rich waters probably originated from the equatorial upwelling. Strong CO<sub>2</sub> undersaturation was associated to the Amazon River plume. Total inorganic carbon drawdown due to biological activity was estimated to be 154 µmol kg<sup>−1</sup> within the river plume. As a consequence, the studied area acted as a net sink of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (from −72.2±10.2 mmol m<sup>−2</sup> month<sup>−1</sup> in February to 14.3±4.5 mmol m<sup>−2</sup> month<sup>−1</sup> in May). This contrasted with the net CO<sub>2</sub> efflux estimated by the main global sea-air CO<sub>2</sub> flux climatologies. Interannual SST changes in the TNA caused by large-scale climatic events could determine the direction and intensity of the sea-air CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in the NEC. Positive temperature anomalies observed in the TNA led to an almost permanent CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing in the NEC in 2010.</p></div>
