Bentel, F. W. Landerer, and C. Boening<br><br>The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key mechanism for
large-scale northward heat transport and thus plays an important role for
global climate. Relatively warm water is transported northward in the upper
layers of the North Atlantic Ocean, and after cooling at subpolar latitudes,
sinks down and is transported back south in the deeper limb of the AMOC. The
utility of in-situ ocean bottom pressure (OBP) observations to infer AMOC
changes at single latitudes has been characterized in recent literature using
output from ocean models. We extend the analysis and examine the utility of
space-based observations of time-variable gravity and the inversion for ocean
bottom pressure to monitor AMOC changes and variability between 20 and

smoothed and filtered to resemble the resolution of the GRACE gravity mission
– and reconstruct geostrophic AMOC transport. Due to the coarse resolution
of GRACE-like OBP fields, we find that leakage of signal across the step
slopes of the ocean basin is a significant challenge at certain latitudes.
However, overall, the inter-annual AMOC anomaly time series can be recovered
from 20 years of monthly GRACE-like OBP fields with errors less than
1 Sverdrup.
