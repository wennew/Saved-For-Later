		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>The Indonesian throughflow (ITF) from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean plays an important role in global ocean circulation and climate. Yet, continuous ITF measurement is difficult and expensive. The longest time series of in situ measurements of the ITF to date were taken in the Makassar Strait, the main pathway of the ITF. Here we have demonstrated a plausible approach to derive the ITF transport proxy using satellite altimetry sea surface height (SSH), gravimetry ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data, in situ measurements from the Makassar Strait from 1996 to 1998 and 2004 to 2011, and a theoretical formulation. We first identified the optimal locations of the correlation between the observed ITF transport through the Makassar Strait and the pressure gradients, represented by the SSH and OBP differences between the Pacific and Indian Oceans at a 1° × 1° horizontal resolution. The optimal locations were found centered at 162°E and 11°N in the Pacific Ocean and 80°E and 0° in the Indian Ocean, then were used in the theoretical formulation to estimate the throughflow. The proxy time series follow the observation time series quite well, with the 1993–2011 mean proxy transport of 11.6 ± 3.2 Sv southward, varying from 5.6 Sv during the strong 1997 El Niño to 16.9 Sv during the 2007 La Nina period, which are consistent with previous estimates. The observed Makassar mean transport is 13.0 ± 3.8 Sv southward over 2004–2011, while the SSH proxy (for the same period) gives an ITF mean transport of 13.9 ± 4.1 Sv and the SSH + OBP proxy (for 2004–2010) is 15.8 ± 3.2 Sv.</p></div>
