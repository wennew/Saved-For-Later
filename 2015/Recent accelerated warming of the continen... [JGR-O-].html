		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) have been launched along a repeat track from New Jersey to Bermuda from the CMV Oleander through the NOAA/NEFSC Ship of Opportunity Program about 14 times per year since 1977. The XBT temperatures on the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) shelf are binned with 10km horizontal and 5m vertical resolution to produce monthly, seasonally and annually-averaged cross-shelf temperature sections. The depth-averaged shelf temperature, <em>T<sub>s</sub></em>, calculated from annually-averaged sections that are spatially-averaged across the shelf, increases at 0.026 ± 0.001 ˚C yr<sup>−1</sup> from 1977-2013, with the recent trend substantially larger than the overall 37-year trend (0.11 ± 0.02 ˚C yr<sup>−1</sup> since 2002). The Oleander temperature sections suggest that the recent acceleration in warming on the shelf is not confined to the surface, but occurs throughout the water column with some contribution from interactions between the shelf and the adjacent Slope Sea reflected in cross-shelf motions of the shelfbreak front. The local warming on the shelf cannot explain the region's amplified rate of sea level rise relative to the global mean. Additionally, <em>T<sub>s</sub></em> exhibits significant interannual variability with the warmest anomalies increasing in intensity over the 37-year record even as the cold anomalies remain relatively uniform throughout the record. <em>T<sub>s</sub></em> anomalies are not correlated with annually-averaged coastal sea level anomalies at zero lag. However, positive correlation is found between 2-year lagged <em>T<sub>s</sub></em> anomalies and coastal sea level anomalies, suggesting that the region's sea level anomalies may serve as a predictor of shelf temperature.
