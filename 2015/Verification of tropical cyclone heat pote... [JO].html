The threshold is specified as the minimum range of TCHP when the ratio of the number of records for TC deepening to the total best-track number of records in a TCHP bin is significantly greater than the reference ratio determined for each domain at a significance level of 0.05. The threshold is relatively low (40–60 kJ cm<sup>−2</sup>) around 5–10°N, west of 120°E and east of 140°E, whereas it is relatively high (80–100 kJ cm<sup>−2</sup>) around 15–20°N.
