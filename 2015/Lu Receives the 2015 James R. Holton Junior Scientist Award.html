Following from his Ph.D. dissertation, Chunsong has (1) proposed new dynamical and microphysical measures to quantify different mixing mechanisms that likely occur in ambient clouds, (2) developed a new parameterization for mixing mechanisms based on the relationship between the two measures, (3) elucidated the effects of secondary entrainment-mixing events on the new parameterization, (4) proposed an approach for distinguishing and linking entrainment mixing and collision coalescence in clouds, and (5) explored the scale dependence of mixing mechanisms. In the words of one of the supporting letters, Chunsong's work &quot;opens the door for possible routine monitoring of entrainment profiles using environmental soundings and surface-based microwave radiometer remote sensing of cloud liquid water content.&quot; His research has tremendous implications for improving cumulus parameterization in global climate models, for improving the representation of intrinsic atmospheric convective processes from the diurnal cycle to the Madden-Julian Oscillation.</p><p>In his very young scientific career, Chunsong has already published a total of 35 peer-reviewed papers; for 18 of them, he has the prestigious role of first author. He is the principal investigator of many research projects and the recipient of numerous awards, including, among others, an AGU Outstanding Student Paper Award and the Meteorological Science Award for Young Scientists from Peking University, China. In summary, Chunsong's accomplishments are truly outstanding on several fronts, including academic research and leadership, which epitomize the spirit of the Holton Award.</p><p>We are extremely pleased to present the Atmospheric Sciences section Holton Junior Scientist Award to Dr. Chunsong Lu.</p><p><em>--</em>William K.
