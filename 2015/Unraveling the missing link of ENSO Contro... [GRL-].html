		<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div><p>Using long daily rainfall (113 years) data, clear evidence of modulation of the statistics of sub-seasonal active and break spells of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) by the El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is unraveled. We show that during the El Niño (La Nina) years, the frequency of longer break (active) spells and shorter active (break) spells increase substantially while the frequency of shorter breaks (active) and longer active (break) spells decrease compared to ENSO-neutral years. It is shown that the large scale teleconnection through which ENSO weakens (strengthens) the ISMR through shortening (lengthening) of the length of rainy season (LRS) also creates a background for modulation of the statistics of sub-seasonal spells leading to a further reduction (increase) in the ISMR during El Niño (La Niña) years. Our findings indicate that the ‘statistics of sub-seasonal spells’ is predictable, brightening the prospect of seasonal prediction of the ISMR.</p></div>
