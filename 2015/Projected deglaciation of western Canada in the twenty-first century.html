Like most of Earth’s mountain glaciers, those in western North America are experiencing rapid mass loss. Projections of future large-scale mass change are based on surface mass balance models that are open to criticism, because they ignore or greatly simplify glacier physics. Here we use a high-resolution regional glaciation model, developed by coupling physics-based ice dynamics with a surface mass balance model, to project the fate of glaciers in western Canada. We use twenty-first-century climate scenarios from an ensemble of global climate models in our simulations; the results indicate that by 2100, the volume of glacier ice in western Canada will shrink by 70 ± 10% relative to 2005. According to our simulations, few glaciers will remain in the Interior and Rockies regions, but maritime glaciers, in particular those in northwestern British Columbia, will survive in a diminished state. We project the maximum rate of ice volume loss, corresponding to peak input of deglacial meltwater to streams and rivers, to occur around 2020–2040. Potential implications include impacts on aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, alpine tourism and water quality.</p>\n<img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ngeo/rss/current/~4/mlPD04IyrbE\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Projected deglaciation of western Canada in the twenty-first century","published":1428303600000,"crawled":1430297756778,"alternate":[{"href":"http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ngeo/rss/current/~3/mlPD04IyrbE/ngeo2407","type":"text/html"}],"author":"Garry K.
