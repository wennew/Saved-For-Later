						<p><b>“15-years seems impossibly short to get an ECS.”<br/>
From trends, yes. But I don’t see how one can make a blanket statement of that type.</b></p>
<p>To my mind,  ECS is a theoretical asymptote that is never reached.  Looking at the Pleistocene paleo data, it seems like temperature declines ever downward punctuated by transient reversals until the ice sheets catastrophically fail.  I don’t see any evidence of equilibrium.  </p>
<p><b>“the relationship is not OLR=kT, it’s more like OLR = kT +/- (a bunch of other first-order feedback factors)”<br/>
The relation is OLR = kT where kT includes all the first order feedback factors. So by definition there are no other first order feedback factors. There might well be other non-feedback causes of variation in OLR that might plausibly appear as noise.</b></p>
<p>It seems a little simplistic to lump first order feedbacks into a single proportionality constant.  </p>
<p><b>The idea that feedbacks might not be constant is intriguing, but strictly speaking I think that such feedbacks would have to be other than first order. But I suppose they could appear to be first order in T while also depending on something else (bilinear behavior, for example).</b></p>
<p>How long will it take for the Arctic sea ice to become ice free.  How long will it take to melt the dreaded methane clathrates?  How long before the ice sheet meltwater and associated sediment causes ocean circulation changes?  Maybe none of this matters, but we don’t know enough </p>
<p><b>“For instance, lets assume the Iris effect is real, but it waxes and wanes based on the AMO cycle.”<br/>
Without a physically plausible model for such effects, they are just speculation. I do not think that such speculation would constitute a valid criticism of an attempt to estimate sensitivity. But they would constitute a reason to be cautious about using the estimate to extrapolate over long time scales.</b></p>
<p>Absolute speculation…. however, so are the current crop of GCMs.  Thats what makes climate so interesting.  The physics, biology and chemistry is pretty well understood on the granular level, it’s the 1,000-year, 30,000-foot view that remains a mystery.</p>

						<p>Chic,</p>
<p>That formula is the change in emitted power from the surface with respect to change in surface temperature.</p>
<p>The calculation that produces 3.6 W/m<sup>2</sup> per 1K surface and atmosphere temperature change – i.e., the “no feedback” response – is not calculated from that formula.</p>
<p>Here’s an example, shown in <a href="http://scienceofdoom.com/2015/04/30/clouds-water-vapor-part-eight-clear-sky-comparison-of-models-with-erbe-and-ceres/" rel="nofollow">Part Eight – Clear Sky Comparison of Models with ERBE and CERES</a> of the actual calculation:</p>
<p><img src="https://scienceofdoom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/chung-2010-fig1b.png?w=500"/></p>
<p>Basically, change the surface and atmospheric temperature by 1K uniformly and calculate the change in OLR at the top of atmosphere at each latitude using the radiative-transfer equations. Then integrate the results to work out the global OLR response.</p>
<p>I had a very brief look at the discussion you highlighted. It would take a lot of time to explain all the flaws in the confused ideas of WUWT commenters so my best recommendation is to read a few textbooks instead of reading comments at WUWT and you will be much better off. </p>
<p>Is it this statement that you are asking about?</p>
<blockquote><p>Exactly, that has been my point all along! Thus, the maximum emitting temperature of a TRUE BB with peak ~15um radiation is ~193K. CO2 is not a true BB, thus the max emitting temperature of the fixed ~15um band CO2 photons is ~193K and cannot exceed that of a true BB having a peak emission at ~15um.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a mishmash of technical words.</p>
<p>A black body at 193K has peak energy at wavelength = 15 μm. That’s just the shape of the radiance vs wavelength curve – the peak moves towards longer wavelengths as it gets colder. </p>
<p>Radiatively-active molecules in the atmosphere (let’s call them them “GHGs” for short) emit at some wavelengths and not others. In the center of the 15 μm band, CO2 emits and absorbs like a blackbody – i.e. its emissivity at that wavelength = 1 – with anything like atmospheric concentrations of GHGs.</p>
<p>For example, at the surface 95% of radiation at “exactly” 15 μm is absorbed within 1m of the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Think of the emissivity of CO2 being a function of wavelength. We would write this ε(λ). ε(λ=15) = 1, ε(λ=10) = 0. And at other wavelengths the emissivity is a value between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Back to the “black body emitter”, as you change the temperature of a black body the peak wavelength moves. At hotter temperatures the peak wavelength is shorter. But the intensity of a hotter body at a given wavelength is always higher than the intensity of a colder body. </p>
<p>Here is a graph of some blackbody curves from 190K to 310K. You can see that the 15 μm intensity is greater at 310K than at 190K. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the people creating your doubts never show you how to properly calculate the reduction in flux using correct physics.  And the people who do know how to do the calculation – for some reason – don’t want to specify that they are actually using the Schwarzschild equation.  They say they are doing “radiative transfer calculations” and omit saying “using the Schwarzschild equation.  I think they skip doing so because this equation doesn’t provide any intuitive feeling for what is going on and the process is complicated.  </p>
<p>dI = n*o*B(λ,T)*ds – n*o*I*ds</p>
<p>dI is the net change in radiation intensity (I) from both emission and absorption moving a short distance ds along a path through the atmosphere.  It varies with wavelength and technically should be written as dI(λ) or dI subscript λ.  It needs to be integrated over all wavelengths before it becomes a change in power flux (dW measured in W/m2).   </p>
<p>The first term is the emission term – how many photons are added by a GHG moving an incremental distance ds on the path from the surface to space or space to the surface.  The second term is the absorption term – how many photons are absorbed by a GHG moving an incremental distance ds on the path from the surface to space or space to the surface.  When dI is numerically integrated from space to the surface over all wavelengths, about 333 W/m2 of DLR is the result.  When dI is numerically integrated from the surface (emitting 390 W/m2) to space over all wavelengths 150 W/m2 is LOST.  And if CO2 is doubled, an additional 3.5 W/m2 is lost.  </p>
<p>n is the amount of GHG per unit volume, which varies with altitude and technically should be written n(z).  </p>
<p>The cross-section, o, tells us how strongly a GHG interacts with radiation of a given wavelength – how effectively that GHG both absorbs and emits per molecule.  The cross-section varies with wavelength and modestly with temperature and pressure.  Technically I should write o(λ,T,P).  Since T and P vary with altitude, we could even say o(λ,T(z),P(z)).  </p>
<p>The Planck function, B(λ,T), takes into account the fraction of molecules in the excited state at any given temperature arising from the Boltzmann distribution for an energy difference of E = hv = hc/λ, some geometric factors, and some quantum mechanics.  When dI = 0, absorption = emission and the intensity of the radiation (I) = B(λ,T) – blackbody intensity.  </p>
<p>The absorption term, n*o*I*ds might be more familiar to you.  Laboratory spectrophotometers use very hot lamps to produce radiation so intense that emission from a sample can be neglected.  Since n and o don’t change along the path in the laboratory and emission is insignificant, integration along a path of length r gives Beer’s Law:  I/I_0 = exp(-n*o*r).  The cross-section o is called the absorption coefficient in chemistry.)      </p>
<p>Every complication raised at WUWT and elsewhere has been dealt in the Schwarzschild equation.  However, WUWT is usually trying to deal with these complications in the context of a crude model that reduces all of the interactions between the atmosphere and radiation to an EMISSIVITY term and a single temperature Ts = 288 degK.  Hopeless, hopeless, hopeless.  </p>
<p>The alternative is mastering the Schwarzschild eqn – which is so complicated that even those who understand the process don’t want explain what they are really doing.  (SOD’s green and blue graph above was constructed by numerically integrating the Schwarzschild equation for an atmosphere with two different concentrations of CO2.)  This required writing a program to use a database with absorption cross-sections (o(λ,T,P)) for all GHGs (tens of thousands of individual lines) and specifying how T, P, density, water vapor vary with altitude.  You can use the online MODTRAN calculator or Spectrocalc to do the work for you, but that requires trusting the developers of this software.  Getting most WUWT readers (and maybe you?) to understand this process is also hopeless, hopeless, hopeless.  The only alternative is to take a 3.7 W/m2 forcing for 2XCO2 on faith as “settled science” (heresy!) or spend much more time reading SOD’s posts.  </p>

						<p>Chic,</p>
<p>Here is part of the code I wrote (from <a href="http://scienceofdoom.com/2013/01/10/visualizing-atmospheric-radiation-part-five-the-code/" rel="nofollow">Part 5</a> of the Visualizing.. series).</p>
<p>You can see two highlights in bold. Notice that I made the option explicitly of “turning off” the linewidth dependence on pressure and temperature for the purposes of education (see the various parts of the series for the results).</p>
<p>===============================</p>
<p>function [tau]=optical_3(vt, v, S, iso, gama, nair, molx, numz, numv, p, p0, Tlayer, T0,…<br/>
Na, rho, mair, dz, mol, nmol, mix, isoprop, contabs, linewon)</p>
<p>% Optical calculates tau as a function of wavenumber, v and layer,<br/>
% i=1-numz-1. Uses data read from the HITRAN database; p, T, rho from each<br/>
% layer; mol, mix, ison as the molecules with the mixing ratio and prescribed<br/>
% isotopes to consider</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>% ——- Iterate through each absorption line for this GHG, j —-</p>
<p>for j=1:immax % each absorption line<br/>
% im(j) is the index for v, S, etc<br/>
% v(im(j))=line center, S(im(j))=line strength, gama(im(j))=half width<br/>
% now a code inefficient method – calculate the profile for each<br/>
% across the entire wavenumber range</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>% then calc the actual line width for this temp &amp; pressure<br/>
if linewon % normal physics<br/>
   <b>ga=gama((im(j))).*(p(i)/p0).*(T0/Tlayer(i)).^nair((im(j)));</b></p>
<p>else % non-real physics for comparison<br/>
    ga=gama(im(j));<br/>
end</p>
<p>% Pekka’s code improvement for v0.9.5<br/>
<b>dt1=1./((vt-v(im(j))).^2+ga^2); % line shape across all wavenumbers</b><br/>
tau(i,:)=tau(i,:)+nummol*S(im(j))*ga*dt1; % change to tau for<br/>
% this layer and line for all wavenumbers<br/>
end % end of each absorption line, j<br/>
end % end of each GHG, m<br/>
…<br/>
================================</p>
<p>This is just straightforward stuff that anyone in atmospheric physics uses when running a line by line calculation – the Lorenz line shape and the dependence of the line width on pressure and temperature.</p>
<p>I get the same spectral results as shown in Collins 2006 inter-comparison study. Of course, he points out that parameterizations (to get quicker results) don’t get as good a result as line by line results. Everyone knows this. Everyone in atmospheric physics..</p>
<p>Collins 2006, spectral result:</p>

						<p>Chic:  Refusing to take things on faith is admirable.  Your quest will only be hopeless, if you don’t have the mathematic background to understand the Schwarzschild eqn and are unwilling to try to express your ideas in terms of equations, rather than less precise words.  </p>
<p>Chic wrote:  “DeWitt noted above that HITRAN data has been calculated from theory as well as measured in the lab and in the field.”  </p>
<p>The HITRAN database was set up in the 1960’s for aeronautical engineers who needed information about radiative heat transfer in the atmosphere under extreme conditions.  The data came from and is maintained spectroscopists.  Climate scientists began using the database long after it was started.  Today, we can use quantum mechanics and modern computers to calculate with reasonable accuracy the vibrational and rotational energy levels of most GHGs, but laboratory measurements are the standard.  </p>
<p>Chic wrote:  “Here is what Roy Clark is saying: “In general, an air parcel in the troposphere emits equal amounts of LWIR flux in the upward and downward directions. The air parcel will also absorb LWIR radiation from the air layers above and below. Usually the downward emitted flux and the upward absorbed flux are similar, whereas the absorbed downward flux from the cooler air layers above will be less than the upward emitted flux. The net effect is therefore a cooling of the atmosphere.”</p>
<p>And Roy Clark is correct.  The troposphere emits more energy as radiation than it gains by absorbing radiation.  The “missing energy” needed to maintain a constant temperature is delivered by convection, mostly when water vapor condenses.  </p>
<p>Reading on, I see that Roy also writes:  “Over the last 50 years, the total daily increase in clear sky LWIR flux from a 70 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration has been ~0.1 MJ.  It is impossible to detect any change in daily or seasonal surface temperature caused by such a small change in flux.”  </p>
<p>Here Roy is wrong:  The surface of the earth is warmed by incoming SWR and DLR and cooled by OLR, convection (mostly evaporation), and conduction at the interface between the surface and atmosphere.  Roy thinks increasing GHGs only change DLR.  However, they also reduce radiative cooling high in the atmosphere to space.  Radiative transfer calculations show that the rise in DLR is only about 0.8 W/m2 at the surface for 2XCO2, but the reduction to radiative cooling to space is about 3.5 W/m2.  This difference means that the atmosphere would warm after an instantaneous doubling of CO2.  Given the small heat capacity of the atmosphere and the large heat capacity of the mixed layer, the atmosphere will warm much faster than the surface.  Convection slows down when the atmosphere warms more that the surface (the lapse rate diminishes).  So most surface warming from 2XCO2 will come from a slowing down of convection, not an increase in DLR.  For more, see  “Taking Greenhouse Warming Seriously” by Linden (a vocal skeptic)</p>
<p><a href="http://www-eaps.mit.edu/faculty/lindzen/230_TakingGr.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www-eaps.mit.edu/faculty/lindzen/230_TakingGr.pdf</a></p>
<p>Convection is critical to understanding our atmosphere, but the only way energy enters and leaves the planet is by radiation.  That is why everyone pays so much attention to radiative imbalance at the TOA and forcing calculated with the Schwarzschild eqn.   </p>
<p>Citing others, Chic wrote:  “These linewidth effects invalidate all of the flux equilibrium assumptions used in radiative forcing calculations.”</p>
<p>In my above discussion of the Schwarzschild eqn, I wrote that absorption cross-section, o, should be written o(λ,T,P) or even o(λ,T(z),P(z)) to take into account how it changes in temperature and pressure with altitude effect the line width.  So this is another one of those complications raised by skeptics that is actually properly handled by radiative transfer calculations.  (Saturation is another.)  </p>
<p>SOD has a post where he discusses experiments where DLR has been measured through a portion of the atmosphere that has just been probed with a radiosonde.  The radiosonde provide temperature and humidity data at all levels in the atmosphere that are inputs needed to calculate DLR using the Schwarzschild eqn.  The results are highly accurate in less humid areas, but less accurate where humidity is high.  This is because water vapor forms dimers that create a “water vapor continuum” – a weak broad band without clear lines.  So the predictions of radiative transfer calculations have been experimentally verified in our atmosphere.  As best I can tell, the imperfections shouldn’t interfere with the reliability of 3.7 W/m2 for 2XCO2.  The biggest issue arises from clouds.</p>
