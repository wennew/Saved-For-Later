					<p>Heat budget analysis of 19 models (see <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Table S1</a>) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) reveals that nonlinear zonal and vertical advection dominate during historical extreme pIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f1">Fig. 1a</a>; for definitions of the individual terms, see the Heat budget analysis section in the Methodology and <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Table S2</a>). For non-extreme pIODs, the magnitude of these two nonlinear advection terms is substantially weaker, almost one-third that of extreme events. The other heat budget terms are also weaker due to the reduced forcing but the dominance of the nonlinear zonal and vertical advection shows that they still play an important role in generating and sustaining moderate pIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). The strong influence of nonlinear zonal and vertical advection during extreme pIOD events is also seen in data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts – Ocean Reanalysis System 3 (ECMWF ORA-S3; <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S1</a>), suggesting that the CMIP5 models are able to capture the dynamics associated with extreme events. Under increasing greenhouse gases, nonlinear zonal and vertical advection remain important contributors to the cooling of the equatorial IO during extreme pIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f1">Fig. 1c</a>) but their amplitude does not change noticeably from the historical simulation. In contrast, moderate pIODs exhibit a distinct increase in amplitude for the two terms (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f1">Fig. 1d</a>).</p>

	<p>The advective terms of the heat budget analysis can be further decomposed into the geostrophic and Ekman components using zonal and meridional surface wind stress to derive the Ekman velocities. The geostrophic velocities can then be approximated by subtracting the ageostrophic component from the total ocean velocities. The results show that the geostrophic velocities dominate the nonlinear zonal and vertical terms (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>) of the total heat budget analysis but as the Coriolis parameter (  <i>f</i>  ) equals zero along the equator, there may be some uncertainties involved. For this analysis, the primary focus is on the total terms (i.e., the geostrophic plus ageostrophic terms as shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f1">Fig. 1</a>) along the equator.</p>

	<h2>Spatial structures associated with IOD events</h2><p>As nonlinear zonal and vertical advections are strong during extreme pIODs, the cold SSTA in the east extends further west (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Figs. S2a,c</a>), assisting the generation of the equatorial positive feedback. This does not occur for moderate pIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Figs. S2b,d</a>), moderate nIODs or strong nIOD events (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S3</a>). As there is no westward extension of the SSTA in the eastern tropical IO during these other events, the positive feedback involving equatorial Kelvin waves cannot be generated. Moreover these nonlinear terms act to damp nIODs, cooling the anomalously warm eastern IO instead of further warming it (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Figs. S4–S6</a>). Thus, NDH is a process unique to the generation of extreme pIOD events.</p><p><a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f3">Figure 3a</a> shows the multi-model ensemble grid-point nonlinear zonal advection for historical extreme pIOD events. Compared with <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f3">Fig. 3c</a>, it is clear that under global warming, there is no significant change in the nonlinear zonal advection term over the equatorial IO (60°E-100°E, 5°S-5°N). However, the importance of this term for the development of extreme pIODs can be seen by comparing it with that of moderate pIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f3">Figs. 3b,d</a>). For extreme pIOD events, nonlinear zonal advection induces cooling in the western and central equatorial IO (between 50°E-90°E). This allows the cold SSTA in the east to extend further westward (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Figs. S2a,c</a>), generating anomalously dry conditions along the equator and pushing the centre of convection further west, in contrast to the conditions during moderate events (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f3">Figs. 3b</a>, <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">S2b</a>). As this occurs, a positive feedback process forms where the westward shift in convection drives a stronger anomalous negative zonal temperature gradient and anomalous easterly zonal winds<sup><a href="#ref8" title="Cai, W. et al. Increased frequency of extreme Indian Ocean Dipole events due to greenhouse warming. Nature 510, 254–258 (2014)." id="ref-link-48">8</a></sup>. These easterly zonal wind anomalies reduce the mean wind along the equator, generating upwelling Kelvin waves that strengthen the cooling in the eastern IO while the thermocline deepens in the west<sup><a href="#ref8" title="Cai, W. et al. Increased frequency of extreme Indian Ocean Dipole events due to greenhouse warming. Nature 510, 254–258 (2014)." id="ref-link-49">8</a></sup>. Consequently, the nonlinear zonal advection process is reinforced and this is conducive for extreme pIOD growth.</p>

	<p>In contrast, during moderate pIOD events in the historical period (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f3">Fig. 3b</a>), moderate nonlinear zonal advective cooling is limited to the eastern equatorial IO (between 90°E-105°E, 10°S-Eq.), and is thus not conducive for shifting convection westward or the ensuing positive feedback along the equator. However under increasing greenhouse gases, nonlinear zonal advection associated with moderate pIODs displays a considerable increase in cooling along the equator, parts of which are significant at the 95% confidence level (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f3">Fig. 3d</a>). This would help to generate cold SSTAs and anomalously dry conditions that are typical of extreme pIODs and therefore, the nonlinear zonal advection process that occurs during moderate pIODs is becoming more extreme-like in a warmer climate. The importance of nonlinear zonal advection is further highlighted by the pattern associated with moderate and strong nIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S5</a>). It is clear that for strong nIODs, there is no substantial westward extension of the nonlinear zonal advection term due to the cooling effect of the NDH process (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Figs. S5a,c</a>).</p><p>Nonlinear vertical advection during extreme events also shows little change under greenhouse warming (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f1">Figs. 1a</a>,c). The influence of this process is largely confined to the eastern equatorial IO (between 75°E-95°E), where anomalous upwelling advects anomalously cool subsurface water towards the surface (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). Over this region, the change between the historical and RCP8.5 periods is indistinguishable for extreme events (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f4">Figs. 4a,c</a>). For moderate pIODs, there is an increase in amplitude over the eastern IO (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f4">Figs. 4b,d</a>), and this suggests that nonlinear vertical advection associated with moderate pIODs is becoming stronger in RCP8.5, as is the case for the nonlinear zonal advection. Nonlinear vertical advection is an important process for extreme events as the cold temperature anomalies in the eastern IO that are reinforced by nonlinear vertical advection can then be advected westward. Furthermore, the extra cooling strengthens the zonal temperature gradient, leading to further weakening of the mean westerly winds. This assists the generation of the positive equatorial feedback involving upwelling (downwelling) Kelvin (Rossby) waves and therefore reinforces the development of extreme pIOD events. In contrast, nIODs are damped by nonlinear vertical advection along the equatorial eastern IO as indicated by the negative anomalies shown in <a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S6</a>. Not only does this damp the warm SSTA in the east, it also weakens the anomalous westerly winds and limits generation of the equatorial positive feedback.</p>

	<h2>Processes governing nonlinear zonal and vertical advection</h2><p>To further examine the behaviour of nonlinear zonal and vertical advection under increasing greenhouse gases, their individual components can be assessed. These are the zonal and vertical current anomalies, and the anomalous zonal and vertical temperature gradients. For zonal current anomalies that occur during extreme pIODs, it is clear that under global warming, there is an increase in the frequency for anomalies of a given magnitude (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f5">Fig. 5a</a>, hatched bars). However despite this large increase in frequency, there is little change in the mean value between the two periods, indicating that the intensity of the anomalies is similar. In contrast, the anomalies associated with moderate pIODs display a significant shift towards more negative values in RCP8.5 and this occurs despite a reduction of moderate events in the future (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f5">Fig. 5d</a>). This demonstrates that under global warming, it is easier to generate negative zonal current anomalies along the equator. With the anomalous zonal temperature gradient displaying a clear shift towards more negative values (i.e., warmer in the west) for both moderate and extreme events (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f4">Figs. 4b,e</a>; changes are significant at the 95% confidence level), the tendency for more frequent occurrences of westward flow in the climate change scenario supports the increased frequency of extreme pIODs through nonlinear zonal advective cooling. The fact that the shift in the magnitude of the advective cooling is more significant for moderate pIODs than for extreme pIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f5">Figs. 5c,f</a>) illustrates the tendency for moderate events to be transformed into extreme events under greenhouse warming. This effect is also depicted in the nonlinear vertical advection as described below.</p>

	<p>The anomalous vertical current that occurs during moderate and extreme events shows almost no change in the mean value (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f6">Figs. 6a,d</a>), indicating that the intensity of the anomalous vertical current is not changing under global warming. In contrast the anomalous vertical temperature gradient associated with moderate and extreme pIOD events displays a strong and significant shift towards more positive values (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f6">Figs. 6b,e</a>), meaning that it becomes stronger. During extreme pIODs, nonlinear vertical advection displays a weak tendency for more negative values in the RCP8.5 simulation but it is not significant at the 95% confidence level (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f6">Fig. 6c</a>). However for moderate pIOD events (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#f6">Fig. 6f</a>), there is a significant shift towards stronger negative values and a distinguishable change in the size of the average anomaly. As such, the nonlinear vertical advection term associated with moderate pIODs becomes more extreme under global warming. This provides strong cooling in the eastern IO and this helps to drive the positive feedback along the equator by reinforcing the anomalous zonal temperature gradient.</p>

	<h2>Cause of response to greenhouse warming</h2><p>The changes that are observed in the anomalous ocean currents and temperature gradients are due to changes in the mean state of the tropical IO. In response to increasing greenhouse gases, the Walker circulation over the IO weakens and the western IO warms faster than the east, a response that many models simulate<sup><a href="#ref22" title="Vecci, G.

The eastward shift of the Walker Circulation in response to global warming and its relationship to ENSO variability. Climate Dyn. 43, 2747–2763 (2014)." id="ref-link-53">25</a></sup> (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S7</a>). Due to this warming pattern, westward shifts of convection can occur more readily as a relatively smaller temperature anomaly is needed and easterly (i.e., negative) zonal wind anomalies can develop more frequently (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S8</a>). This increased frequency of zonal wind stress anomalies means that easterly zonal current and upward (i.e., positive) vertical current anomalies can also occur more often. For the anomalous temperature gradients, the tropical IO warming pattern strengthens the anomalous negative zonal temperature gradient and because the ocean surface warms faster than at depth under global warming, the anomalous vertical temperature gradient becomes stronger. The westward shift in convection also gives rise to the positive feedback along the equator involving upwelling Kelvin waves<sup><a href="#ref8" title="Cai, W. et al. Increased frequency of extreme Indian Ocean Dipole events due to greenhouse warming. Nature 510, 254–258 (2014)." id="ref-link-54">8</a></sup>. This positive feedback reinforces the nonlinear zonal and vertical advection processes and thus the development of extreme pIODs can occur more frequently.</p><p>In contrast, the damping of nIODs by NDH weakens under global warming but the other heat budget terms do not change noticeably (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S4</a>). This weaker damping is also a response to mean state change as the weaker Walker circulation reduces the anomalous westerly winds that occur during nIODs. Therefore, the anomalous zonal and vertical currents are also decreased and their associated cooling rates are weaker. This is particularly noticeable for nonlinear vertical advection (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Fig. S6</a>) and this weaker cooling may allow the equatorial IO to warm during nIODs in the future (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Figs. S3c,d</a>). Despite this, there is no considerable change in the frequency of moderate or strong nIODs (<a href="/srep/2015/150626/srep11697/full/srep11697.html#supplementary-information">Table S1</a>) as the mean state change makes it more difficult for strong nIOD events to occur. This response highlights the importance of NDH for extreme pIODs.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>An ensemble of 19 CMIP5 models shows that nonlinear zonal and vertical advection are important processes during extreme pIODs, yet under increasing greenhouse gases, the amplitude of these two processes does not change considerably. Examination of the two nonlinear terms and their individual components reveals that the increased occurrence of extreme events is largely due to changes in the mean state. In a warmer climate, the western tropical IO warms faster than the eastern IO. This means that the temperature anomalies required to shift convection westward are relatively smaller in the future and therefore, it becomes easier for these shifts to occur and so the frequency of their occurrence increases. During extreme pIOD events, nonlinear zonal and vertical advections stimulate a positive feedback process along the equator that reinforces the convection shift. This leads to stronger anomalous easterly winds which in turn drive upwelling equatorial Kelvin waves that increase upwelling off the Sumatra-Java coast. As the eastern IO cools further, the western tropical IO thermocline deepens, generating a stronger zonal temperature gradient and therefore, stronger anomalous easterly winds. Due to the weakening of the Walker circulation under greenhouse warming, the frequency of easterly wind anomalies increases, which in turn allows easterly zonal and upward vertical current anomalies to occur more often. This behaviour, combined with the positive feedback from westward convection shifts, means that moderate pIOD events become more extreme and the frequency of extreme pIODs increases in a warmer climate.</p>
