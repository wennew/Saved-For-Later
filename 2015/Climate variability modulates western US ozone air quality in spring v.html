	<p>Observed springtime variability in WUS surface ozone in association with La Niña events and with the Mt. Pinatubo eruption manifests as a statistically significant shift, upwards and downwards respectively, in the high tails of the MDA8 ozone probability distribution, in contrast to an ENSO-neutral spring (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). We investigate the similarities of surface ozone distributions associated with these different climate states with a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, the nonparametric test for the equality of continuous one-dimensional distributions (see Methods section). The number of samples out of 1,000 KS tests for which a significant difference occurs (that is, the null hypothesis, that the distributions are drawn from the same population, is rejected; <i>P</i> value &lt;0.05) is summarized in the top right corner of <a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>. Considering the entire distribution, we find ‘structural’ but insignificant differences (open bars) between La Niña and El Niño. However, focusing the analysis on the high tails, that is, the right side of the distributions above the respective median values, we find significant differences (filled bars) for both La Niña and Mt. Pinatubo compared with neutral and El Niño springs.</p>

The springtime MDA8 ozone in 1999 and 2011, both preceded by a strong La Niña winter, fluctuates strongly on shorter timescales than in 1992 or 2007 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f4">Fig. 4a,c versus b,d</a>), consistent with the transient, localized nature of deep tropopause folding events. Supporting this conclusion, the autocorrelation timescales for springtime MDA8 ozone following the 1998–1999 and 2010–2011 La Niña events are about half of those in 1992 and 2007 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 11</a>).

	<p>These deep intrusion events can push observed surface ozone levels to approach or exceed the 75-p.p.b.v. NAAQS level. If such exceptional events were not properly screened, they could affect attainment status, with more frequent impact for lower levels of the standard (for example, 65<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>p.p.b.v.). Even in the absence of North American anthropogenic emissions, daily MDA8 background ozone at WUS sites would exceed 60<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>p.p.b.v. on 13<span class="mb">%</span> of site-days in the model during the high-ozone springs when deep stratospheric intrusions were particularly active (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f4">Fig.4e versus f</a>). During these seasons with higher background, there is less room for the addition of domestically produced ozone to achieve a targeted level of air quality.</p><h2>Changes in mean ozone aloft</h2><p>We next examine the extent to which WUS surface ozone variability correlates with mean ozone levels in the free troposphere and in the lower stratosphere. Continuous ozone profile measurements are limited. We use the 12-month running average of weekly ozonesonde profile measurements averaged over 250–150<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa to explore large-scale variability of UTLS ozone over high-latitude (Edmonton; <a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f5">Fig. 5</a>) versus mid-latitude (Trinidad Head; <a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f6">Fig. 6a,b</a>) regions in western North America. For WUS free tropospheric ozone, we focus our analysis in April–May when the strong influence from STT is most likely to reach surface air due to deep mixing depths (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f6">Fig. 6c</a>). Variability of WUS free tropospheric ozone in summer and fall may reflect processes other than STT. To determine robust changes in the time evolution of ozone aloft, we compare observational records and model results co-sampled with observations in space and time with the ‘true average’ (that is, continuous temporal sampling) determined from daily ozone fields archived from the model. Our analysis indicates that the available weekly ozone profile measurements at Trinidad Head and Boulder were too infrequent to capture the actual variability of mean mid-tropospheric ozone in April–May (see Methods section). For 12-month running averages, the weekly sampling is sufficient to capture most of the variability (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f5">Figs 5</a> and <a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f6">6b</a>).</p>

	<p>The primary mechanism for the transport of stratospheric ozone to the middle and lower troposphere is descent through the dry airstream of mid-latitude cyclones<sup><a href="#ref42" title="Danielsen, E.

The enhanced storm-track activity across the central WUS and associated meandering jet stream related to La Niña increase the frequency of cold frontal passages that facilitate deep tropopause folds and isentropic transport of stratospheric ozone into the lower troposphere.

Supporting this conclusion, the springtime variance in daily O<sub>3</sub>Strat at 500<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa over the WUS is a factor of two greater following La Niña than El Niño (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f7">Fig. 7a versus d</a>).

Stronger day-to-day fluctuations in stratospheric influence at 500<span class="mb"><span class="mb"> </span></span>hPa during La Niña springs are consistent with the significant shifts in the upper half of the daily ozone and O<sub>3</sub>Strat distributions at surface sites (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f3">Fig. 3</a>). In contrast, the influence of STT on surface ozone during winter is limited, since most stratospheric intrusions during winter do not reach surface air due to boundary layer inversions.</p><p>During El Niño, the most prominent change in the atmospheric circulation over the Pacific–North America sector is an eastward extension and equatorward shift of the subtropical jet stream and storm track from the International Date Line to the southern US–Gulf of Mexico<sup><a href="#ref44" title="Trenberth, K.

The positive AO is characterized by the polar jet blowing strongly and consistently from west to east, as it did in 1992 following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 16a</a>), keeping ozone-rich cold Arctic air locked in the polar region<sup><a href="#ref50" title="Hess, P.

Previous work suggests a decrease in the global annual mean STT of ozone in 1992–1993 (ref. <a href="#ref51" title="Tang, Q., Hess, P. G., Brown-Steiner, B. &amp; Kinnison, D. E.

The polar jet stream was unusually contorted during the late springs of 1991 and 2012, facilitating mixing of ozone-rich, stratospheric air into the WUS lower troposphere (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 16b,c</a>). The meandering jet stream, conducive to deep tropopause folds, contributed to the anomalously frequent high-ozone events observed at the WUS surface in 1991 and 2012 (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Given a high level of internal variability, the mid-latitude atmospheric responses differ during individual ENSO events<sup><a href="#ref44" title="Trenberth, K. E. et al.

Simulated mean stratospheric contribution to springtime WUS surface ozone following the La Niña winter of 1988–1989 is not as prominent as those La Niña events in recent decades (<a href="/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8105/full/ncomms8105.html#supplementary-information">Supplementary Fig. 17</a>). Nevertheless, simulated enhancements of stratospheric contribution during the 1990s–2000s La Niña events are noticeable from all El Niño and neutral years (except 1991) over the entire 1980–2012 period. Future work should examine the role of internal variability in addition to La Niña in contributing to stratospheric intrusion frequency and surface ozone variability over the WUS. The relationship between the polar jet and the frequency of surface high-ozone events documented here serves as motivation, in addition to the relationships with weather extremes, to develop a mechanistic understanding of the dynamical processes driving variability in the location and meandering of the mid-latitude jet<sup><a href="#ref52" title="Francis, J.
