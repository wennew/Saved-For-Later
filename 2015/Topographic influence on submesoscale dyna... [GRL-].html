		<h3>Abstract</h3><div><p>Topography influences the circulation in the Southern Ocean, generating stationary meanders in the lee of topographic features, triggering hot spots of mesoscale eddy kinetic energy, and modifying jets and fronts. However, the relationship between topography and submesoscale flows (with length scales of order 1–10 km) has not yet been explored.
